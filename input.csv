Title,Abstract
Peer relationship increasing the risk of social media addiction among Chinese adolescents who have negative emotions,"Social media has expanded the scope and method of interpersonal communication, and presents the risk of social media addiction as well. This study reported the psychometrics of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) and further analyzed the moderating role of peer relationship on the association between negative emotions and risk of social media addiction. A total of 1258 survey participants were asked to complete a set of scales online. Exploratory structural equation modeling enabled BSMAS to reveal a solid one-factor structure with satisfactory internal consistency coefficient. Criterion-related validity and variance explanation rate analysis implied a positive relationship between negative emotions and risk of social media addiction, and identified the significant contributions of negative emotions and peer relationship to the risk of social media addiction. Moderation analysis demonstrated that peer relationship positively moderated the effect of negative emotions on the risk of social media addiction. However, gender was not a moderator affecting negative emotions on the risk of social media addiction. BSMAS was a valid tool for measuring the risk of social media addiction among Chinese adolescents. Lastly, peer relationship is a positive moderator in influencing negative emotions and risk of social media addiction."
A novel machine learning and face recognition technique for fake accounts detection system on cyber social networks,"Online Social Networks (OSN) such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others have seen rapid growth in recent years. Such applications provide attractive online social networks and communications with the opportunity to connect with relatives and acquaintances, meet new people, enter communities, talk, exchange photos, organize events, and network with others who are close to real-life; unfortunately, on the other hand, they also raise privacy and security issues. We identified OSN threats in this paper and recommended a digital face-processing authentication method as a double-factor authentication after entering the password using Matlab. After applying deep learning classification by attending to a real dataset from the live webcam to train the model, we achieved the best accuracy rate of 95%. However, such methods have yet to be deployed to all social networks, so we also mentioned the problem of fake accounts, which is one of the most significant problems in OSN. These are effective tools for executing spam campaigns and spreading malware and phishing attacks. Fake accounts could lead to the loss of money for businesses, loss of reputation, stealing information for malicious purposes, and much more. This study is related to detecting fake and legitimate profiles on OSN. For this purpose, we chose two datasets that contain fake and legitimate accounts on Facebook and Instagram. Each contains different features after applying machine learning using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbour, Boosted Tree, Neural Networks, SVM Kernal, and Logistec Regression Kernal. SVM achieved the highest classification accuracy for the Fake Profiles detection datasets with 97.1%."
Linking health impact and Post-environmental impact assessments: a case of municipal sewage treatment plant volatile organic compounds,"Deficiencies remain in current health impact assessment (HIA) and environmental impact assessment (EIA) projects. To address the shortcomings in EIA theory, a case of odors from a municipal sewage treatment plant (MSTP) was examined and geographic factors were employed to associate the spatial diffusion of the pollutants with the population’s activities based on land-use attributes. After screening the MSTP priority control pollutants, odors, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia were selected for this study. Then, the spatial parameters for the pollutant simulation were surveyed, including parameters concerning the meteorological analysis, environmental emission monitoring, and emission source analysis, and a prediction of the pollutant diffusion as imaged and identified. The types of human social activity and exposure patterns were sorted as land-use attributes. An integration of the spatial diffusion of the pollutants with the exposure profiles of the scenario population according to the land-use attributes was achieved using counterpart spatial coordination factors. In our study, the commonly applied method of HIA risk calculation was followed and then extended by the spatial techniques introduced. The results of the scenario HIA contours are presented here, making it easy to determine the acceptable levels of the MSTP odor pollutants on a geographic scale. This study examines a significant approach to associate HIA with post-EIA via spatial factors and addresses the deficiencies of HIA in EIA empirical applications."
"Blockchain-enabled supply chain: analysis, challenges, and future directions","Managing the integrity of products and processes in a multi-stakeholder supply chain environment is a significant challenge. Many current solutions suffer from data fragmentation, lack of reliable provenance, and diverse protocol regulations across multiple distributions and processes. Amongst other solutions, Blockchain has emerged as a leading technology, since it provides secure traceability and control, immutability, and trust creation among stakeholders in a low cost IT solution. Although Blockchain is making a significant impact in many areas, there are many impediments to its widespread adoption in supply chains. This article is the first survey of its kind, with detailed analysis of the challenges and future directions in Blockchain-enabled supply chains. We review the existing digitalization of the supply chain including the role of GS1 standards and technologies. Current use cases and startups in the field of Blockchain-enabled supply chains are reviewed and presented in tabulated form. Technical and non-technical challenges in the adoption of Blockchain for supply chain applications are critically analyzed, along with the suitability of various consensus algorithms for applications in the supply chain. The tools and technologies in the Blockchain ecosystem are depicted and analyzed. Some key areas as future research directions are also identified which must be addressed to realize mass adoption of Blockchain-based in supply chain traceability. Finally, we propose MOHBSChain, a novel framework for Blockchain-enabled supply chains."
Exploring Temporal Analytics in Fog-Cloud Architecture for Smart Office HealthCare,"Ever since the boost realized in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), market is flooded with high-end multi-tasking devices, presenting a real-time computational environment for technologies like Internet of Things (IoT). With computation at user-end, it provides a fog-based computing paradigm to generate time senstive results, which along with cloud storage presents a comprehensive Fog-Cloud computing paradigm. Because of these reasons, the work presented in this paper focuses on utilizing the potential of IoT Technology to provide a novel Fog-Cloud architecture for efficient healthcare services in smart office. Specifically, a Fog-Cloud architecture has been proposed to monitor and analyze various health attributes of a person during his working hours. Moreover, the framework indulges various activities in the ambient office environment with the purpose of analyzing it for health severity. In order to realize this, a probabilistic measure, named as Severity Index (SI) is defined to evaluate the adverse effects of different activities on personal health. Finally, an application scenario of temporal healthcare predictive monitoring and alert generation is discussed to depict the ideology of Smart Office Healthcare. In order to validate the system, an experimental implmentation is performed on heterogenous datasets. The results obtained in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques show that the proposed model is highly efficient and accurate for providing appropriate healthcare environment during working hours of a person in a smart office."
Virtual team training with Mixed Reality and Virtual Reality – benefits and limitations illustrated on the example of two paramedic classes,"In the field of medical case simulations, strong technologization has been observed for years, for example through Extended Reality. This study examined the impact of Virtual and Mixed Reality (VR, resp. MR) on the team training of paramedic trainees. In the quasi-experimental cross-sectional controlled comparison study, participants were assigned to an experimental group (= EG, mixed reality with manikin) and a comparison group (= CG, virtual reality without manikin). After a virtual case simulation, “VR sickness”, sense of presence, motivation, and sociodemographic variables were elicited. Parametric tests were used for mean comparison and correlation analysis. A total of 20 participants were evaluated in the EG and 16 in the CG. In both groups, high intrinsic motivation (mean 5.32/7), an acceptable sense of spatial presence (mean 4.24/6), and advanced usability (mean 68.54/100), were observed. VR sickness symptoms were present (SSQ total score: 11.43). In both groups, correlation was found between Identified Regulation and Usability (EG: r = .74, p < .001, CG: r = .76, p < .001). The same pattern could be observed for Intrinsic Motivation and Usability (EG: r = .83, p < .001, CG: r = .70, p = .003). Spatial Presence and Usability were also correlated in both groups (EG: r = .71, p < .001, CG: r = .61, p = .01). A significant mean score difference (p = .021) was found for Amotivation between the EG (Mean = 1.92/6) and the CG (Mean = 1.56/6). VR and MR are potential learning methods if they are implemented in a planned manner by competent faculty. Our recommendation is to use setup checklists, but also a competence-oriented approach, considering fiction contract and structured debriefing. The use of wireless head-mounted displays and ""data gloves"" is also recommended."
Virtual reality and gamification in education: a systematic review,"This study aims to analyze the use of virtual reality and gamification in education by examining the existing literature. In addition to virtual reality, this study focuses on gamified virtual reality learning environments which refer to virtual reality learning environments that integrate gamification elements and mechanisms. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, a systematic literature review was carried out. No limitations were set regarding educational level, type of study, subject, and publication year. The related articles were retrieved from 5 databases (ERIC, Google Scholar, IEEE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science). A total of 112 articles were included, 16 research questions were explored, and a thematic analysis was conducted. To evaluate the quality of the articles included, the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used. According to the findings, gamification and virtual reality support several pedagogical theories and approaches. Their adoption to and integration into education can enrich and transform traditional teaching and learning and were assessed positively by students and teachers. Gamification elements significantly affected students’ achievements. In comparison to traditional learning environments, gamified virtual reality learning environments were more motivating, engaging, and interactive and offered more opportunities for personalized and collaborative learning. Through the realistic and interactive experiences offered, students’ immersion and social presence can be enhanced, knowledge acquisition can be improved, and material comprehension can be facilitated. Positive changes in student attitude, behavior, and mentality as well as improved cognitive, physical, and social–emotional development were observed. When using learning environments that integrate both virtual reality and gamification, students’ learning outcomes, motivation, engagement, and self-efficacy were increased. Additionally, students’ academic performance, active involvement, and satisfaction were improved. Students’ curiosity, imagination, focus, and interest were enhanced and their skills and competences were developed. Finally, gamified virtual reality emerged as an effective educational tool that can improve learning at all educational levels, subjects, and contexts."
Wordsphere: virtual reality text input interface,"In recent years, virtual reality has moved from a fantasy or science fiction theme to a reality increasingly closer to our homes and computers. As is the case of various technological advances, from military and scientific use to casual and routine use, which are increasingly adapted to day-to-day use cases, as is observed with the announcement of a new fashionable term, the metaverse. In the same way, this possibility today in the sight of innovators, entrepreneurs, merchants, and businesspeople, among others, begins to generate applications that show benefits in different branches such as education, medicine, psychology, human resources, real estate, tourism. The detail is that within the innovation, very little is being done for an improvement in text input, which generates a stagnation for continuing with a method of capturing text, even already known with lack of intuition and not optimal, such as the provided by the QWERTY keyboard. This article presents a proposal for a new text input method, a three-dimensional (3D) text input prototype focused on immersion in virtual reality, Wordsphere, which takes advantage of the need for technological adoption for novice users in virtual reality and, in turn, leaves on the table future lines of work and research."
Effectiveness of Virtual Reality in Improving Oral Health,"The traditional methods of educating the population to empower them and improve their daily lifestyle as well as their general health and their health literacy, has changed over the years. The current generation is technologically oriented; therefore use of technology to gain their interest is paramount in health education. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of using a virtual reality tool compared to a traditional method of dental education among school children aged 10-18 years old in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A longitudinal phase of assessment for student’s daily dental hygiene was assessed using a mixed method. There was a statistically significant improvement in plaque index score (p=.000), plaque percentage (p=.000), and brushing score (p=.000), when comparing education using Virtual Reality vs traditional method. Conclusion: Use of virtual reality education is more effective in improving the oral health status of children compared to the traditional educational method."
Utilizing Virtual Reality for Distraction in Emergency Care,"Purpose of ReviewThis paper will review the published literature involving virtual reality as a tool for distraction during emergency department waiting periods and minor procedures, with a special emphasis on virtual reality’s analgesic and anxiolytic potential.Recent FindingsWith virtual reality becoming increasingly accessible and affordable, clinicians have started utilizing virtual reality as an intervention in the emergency department for pediatric and adult patients. These interventions have been implemented during waiting periods and minor procedures, showing promise for anxiolysis, analgesia, and distress management.SummaryThis paper summarizes the evolution of virtual reality use in patient interventions, with a focus on emergency department applications, logistical considerations, and future directions. Virtual reality is not discussed as a replacement for pharmaceuticals; rather, it is compared against inconsistent standard-of-care distractions (e.g., televisions, tablets) as a more immersive option. Positive findings with this technology are tempered by the limitations of current research, but VR still holds great potential."
Brief Report: Virtual Reality to Raise Awareness About Autism,"PurposeThe purpose of the study was to develop and test a virtual reality application designed to put the participants “in the shoes” of an autistic person during a routine task.MethodThe study involved a randomized controlled trial that included 103 participants recruited from a technical college. Each participant responded to three questionnaires to measure attitudes, knowledge, and openness toward autism. Prior to responding to these questionnaires, the participants in the experimental group also completed an 8-min virtual reality simulation designed by the research team in collaboration with autistic individuals.ResultsThe participants who completed the virtual reality simulation reported better attitudes, more knowledge, and higher openness toward autism than the participants in the control group.ConclusionThe results of the study suggest that virtual reality simulations are promising tools to raise awareness about autism."
Towards Education 4.0 in Geotechnical Engineering Using a Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality Visualization Platform,"Education 4.0 can play a significant role in the future of geotechnical engineering education. It can provide personalized and equitable learning experiences and be used to develop skills for the fourth industrial revolution in geotechnical engineering. In this paper, we explore the application of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) models, as part of Education 4.0, to enhance the presentation and communication of soil mechanics concepts. A detailed step-by-step process for creating 3D representations of geotechnical concepts, including texturing, UV mapping, animation, and export and publishing techniques, is introduced. For this purpose, two powerful 3D modeling and animation software programs, Autodesk Maya and Blender, are employed to develop geotechnical avatars in a soil mechanics laboratory. In Autodesk Maya, a detailed representation of the soil phase diagram is presented, while Blender is utilized to create a Consolidated Undrained (CU) triaxial laboratory experiment. The geotechnical testing avatars are then uploaded to Sketchfab, a popular publishing website that supports AR/VR formats. We also explore the potential for establishing a virtual laboratory for geotechnical engineering, highlighting the transformative possibilities it offers in terms of practical learning experiences and educational accessibility."
"Lightness constancy in reality, in virtual reality, and on flat-panel displays","Virtual reality (VR) displays are being used in an increasingly wide range of applications. However, previous work shows that viewers often perceive scene properties very differently in real and virtual environments and so realistic perception of virtual stimuli should always be a carefully tested conclusion, not an assumption. One important property for realistic scene perception is surface color. To evaluate how well virtual platforms support realistic perception of achromatic surface color, we assessed lightness constancy in a physical apparatus with real lights and surfaces, in a commercial VR headset, and on a traditional flat-panel display. We found that lightness constancy was good in all three environments, though significantly better in the real environment than on the flat-panel display. We also found that variability across observers was significantly greater in VR and on the flat-panel display than in the physical environment. We conclude that these discrepancies should be taken into account in applications where realistic perception is critical but also that in many cases VR can be used as a flexible alternative to flat-panel displays and a reasonable proxy for real environments."
Exploratory analysis of the effectiveness of virtual reality in cardiovascular rehabilitation,"Virtual reality therapy has been shown to be effective in coping with psychological disorders accompanied by cardiovascular disease. Age appears to be a factor that can affect the effectiveness of psychological therapy in a virtual environment. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore whether there are age-related differences in the effectiveness of reducing levels of depression and anxiety during a virtual reality psychological intervention implemented for rehabilitation. The study included 25 younger (< 65 years) and 25 older (65 +) patients with cardiovascular disease who participated in virtual reality therapy to cope with anxiety and depression. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depressive disorders before and after intervention. Significant reductions in anxiety and depression scores after intervention were observed in both age-matched groups, and no significant differences were found between the younger and older participants. Further evaluation of patient age as a predictor of the effectiveness of psychological intervention in virtual reality did not show a significant effect of age on effectiveness in reducing anxiety and depressive disorders. The results obtained suggest that older patients benefit similarly to younger patients from psychological intervention in a virtual environment. Furthermore, age does not appear to be considered a predictor of effectiveness in reducing the level of anxiety and depression in patients with cardiovascular disease using virtual reality therapy."
Designing for collaborative learning in immersive virtual reality: a systematic literature review,"Immersive learning technologies such as virtual reality have long been deemed as the next generation of digital learning environments. There is a limited number of studies addressing how immersive technologies can be designed, applied, and studied in collaborative learning settings. This paper presents a systematic review of empirical studies reporting on use of immersive virtual reality in collaborative learning within educational and professional learning settings. 11 studies have been grouped and coded in a textual narrative synthesis, outlining the pedagogical concepts behind the learning design, as well as the design of virtual reality environments and the collaborative learning activities in which the technology is employed. The results suggest that collaborative learning in virtual reality can currently be conceptualised as a shared experience in an immersive, virtually mediated space, where there is a shared goal/problem which learners must attend to collaboratively. This conceptualisation implies a need to design technologies, environments, and activities that support participation and social interaction, fostering collaborative learning processes. Based on the outlined conceptualisation, we present a series of recommendations for designing for collaborative learning in immersive virtual reality. The paper concludes that collaborative learning in virtual reality creates a practice- and reflection space, where learning is perceived as engaging, without the risk of interfering with actual practices. Current designs however struggle with usability, realism, and facilitating social interaction. The paper further identifies a need for future research into what happens within virtual reality, rather than only looking at post-virtual reality evaluations."
Implementation of virtual reality in healthcare: a scoping review on the implementation process of virtual reality in various healthcare settings,"BackgroundVirtual reality (VR) is increasingly used in healthcare settings as recent technological advancements create possibilities for diagnosis and treatment. VR is a technology that uses a headset to simulate a reality in which the user is immersed in a virtual environment, creating the impression that the user is physically present in this virtual space. Despite the potential added value of virtual reality technology in healthcare, its uptake in clinical practice is still in its infancy and challenges arise in the implementation of VR. Effective implementation could improve the adoption, uptake, and impact of VR. However, these implementation procedures still seem to be understudied in practice. This scoping review aimed to examine the current state of affairs in the implementation of VR technology in healthcare settings and to provide an overview of factors related to the implementation of VR.MethodsTo give an overview of relevant literature, a scoping review was undertaken of articles published up until February 2022, guided by the methodological framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005). The databases Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were systematically searched to identify records that highlighted the current state of affairs regarding the implementation of VR in healthcare settings. Information about each study was extracted using a structured data extraction form.ResultsOf the 5523 records identified, 29 were included in this study. Most studies focused on barriers and facilitators to implementation, highlighting similar factors related to the behavior of adopters of VR and the practical resources the organization should arrange for. However, few studies focus on systematic implementation and on using a theoretical framework to guide implementation. Despite the recommendation of using a structured, multi-level implementation intervention to support the needs of all involved stakeholders, there was no link between the identified barriers and facilitators, and specific implementation objectives or suitable strategies to overcome these barriers in the included articles.ConclusionTo take the implementation of VR in healthcare to the next level, it is important to ensure that implementation is not studied in separate studies focusing on one element, e.g., healthcare provider-related barriers, as is common in current literature. Based on the results of this study, we recommend that the implementation of VR entails the entire process, from identifying barriers to developing and employing a coherent, multi-level implementation intervention with suitable strategies. This implementation process could be supported by implementation frameworks and ideally focus on behavior change of stakeholders such as healthcare providers, patients, and managers. This in turn might result in increased uptake and use of VR technologies that are of added value for healthcare practice."
Virtual and augmented reality in biomedical engineering,"In the future, extended reality technology will be widely used. People will be led to utilize virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in their daily lives, hobbies, numerous types of entertainment, and employment. Medical augmented reality has evolved with applications ranging from medical education to picture-guided surgery. Moreover, a bulk of research is focused on clinical applications, with the majority of research devoted to surgery or intervention, followed by rehabilitation and treatment applications. Numerous studies have also looked into the use of augmented reality in medical education and training.MethodsUsing the databases Semantic Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect, a scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. To find other articles, a manual search was also carried out in Google Scholar. This study presents studies carried out over the previous 14 years (from 2009 to 2023) in detail. We classify this area of study into the following categories: (1) AR and VR in surgery, which is presented in the following subsections: subsection A: MR in neurosurgery; subsection B: spine surgery; subsection C: oral and maxillofacial surgery; and subsection D: AR-enhanced human-robot interaction; (2) AR and VR in medical education presented in the following subsections; subsection A: medical training; subsection B: schools and curriculum; subsection C: XR in Biomedicine; (3) AR and VR for rehabilitation presented in the following subsections; subsection A: stroke rehabilitation during COVID-19; subsection B: cancer and VR, and (4) Millimeter-wave and MIMO systems for AR and VR.ResultsIn total, 77 publications were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Four distinct AR and/or VR applications groups could be differentiated: AR and VR in surgery (N = 21), VR and AR in Medical Education (N = 30), AR and VR for Rehabilitation (N = 15), and Millimeter-Wave and MIMO Systems for AR and VR (N = 7), where N is number of cited studies. We found that the majority of research is devoted to medical training and education, with surgical or interventional applications coming in second. The research is mostly focused on rehabilitation, therapy, and clinical applications. Moreover, the application of XR in MIMO has been the subject of numerous research.ConclusionExamples of these diverse fields of applications are displayed in this review as follows: (1) augmented reality and virtual reality in surgery; (2) augmented reality and virtual reality in medical education; (3) augmented reality and virtual reality for rehabilitation; and (4) millimeter-wave and MIMO systems for augmented reality and virtual reality."
An immersive virtual reality learning environment with CFD simulations: Unveiling the Virtual Garage concept,"Virtual reality has become a significant asset to diversify the existing toolkit supporting engineering education and training. The cognitive and behavioral advantages of virtual reality (VR) can help lecturers reduce entry barriers to concepts that students struggle with. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are imperative tools intensively utilized in the design and analysis of chemical engineering problems. Although CFD simulation tools can be directly applied in engineering education, they bring several challenges in the implementation and operation for both students and lecturers. In this study, we develop the “Virtual Garage” as a task-centered educational VR application with CFD simulations to tackle these challenges. The Virtual Garage is composed of a holistic immersive virtual reality experience to educate students with a real-life engineering problem solved by CFD simulation data. The prototype is tested by graduate students (n = 24) assessing usability, user experience, task load and simulator sickness via standardized questionnaires together with self-reported metrics and a semi-structured interview. Results show that the Virtual Garage is well-received by participants. We identify features that can further leverage the quality of the VR experience with CFD simulations. Implications are incorporated throughout the study to provide practical guidance for developers and practitioners."
Virtual reality headsets for perimetry testing: a systematic review,"Standard automated perimetery is considered the gold standard for evaluating a patient’s visual field. However, it is costly and requires a fixed testing environment. In response, perimetric devices using virtual reality (VR) headsets have emerged as an alternative way to measure visual fields in patients. This systematic review aims to characterize both novel and established VR headsets in the literature and explore their potential applications within visual field testing. A search was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Core Collection (Web of Science) for articles published until January 2023. Subject headings and keywords related to virtual reality and visual field were used to identify studies specific to this topic. Records were first screened by title/abstract and then by full text using predefined criteria. Data was extracted accordingly. A total of 2404 records were identified from the databases. After deduplication and the two levels of screening, 64 studies describing 36 VR headset perimetry devices were selected for extraction. These devices encompassed various visual field measurement techniques, including static and kinetic perimetry, with some offering vision rehabilitation capabilities. This review reveals a growing consensus that VR headset perimetry devices perform comparably to, or even better than, standard automated perimetry. They are better tolerated by patients in terms of gaze fixation, more cost-effective, and generally more accessible for patients with limited mobility."
Immersive virtual reality in orthopaedics—a narrative review,"This narrative review explores the applications and benefits of immersive virtual reality (VR) in orthopaedics, with a focus on surgical training, patient functional recovery, and pain management.MethodsThe review examines existing literature and research studies on immersive VR in orthopaedics, analyzing both experimental and clinical studies.ResultsImmersive VR provides a realistic simulation environment for orthopaedic surgery training, enhancing surgical skills, reducing errors, and improving overall performance. In post-surgical recovery and rehabilitation, immersive VR environments can facilitate motor learning and functional recovery through virtual embodiment, motor imagery during action observation, and virtual training. Additionally VR-based functional recovery programs can improve patient adherence and outcomes. Moreover, VR has the potential to revolutionize pain management, offering a non-invasive, drug-free alternative. Virtual reality analgesia acts by a variety of means including engagement and diverting patients’ attention, anxiety reduction, and specific virtual-body transformations.ConclusionImmersive virtual reality holds significant promise in orthopaedics, demonstrating potential for improved surgical training, patient functional recovery, and pain management but further research is needed to fully exploit the benefits of VR technology in these areas."
"Design, development, and evaluation of educational virtual reality environment: EVRECA","Numerous studies have been carried out in recent years on the use of virtual reality (VR) technologies and environments in education. On the other hand, many researchers have drawn attention to the inadequacy of studies that deal with the education process in virtual reality environments from a broad perspective. In this research, the process of designing, developing, and testing an educational virtual reality environment in the light of a design model that includes pedagogical, design, and technical steps have been experienced and reported with a holistic perspective. The study was carried out in a two meso cycle structure based on the educational design research methodology. In the scope of research, the educational virtual reality campus platform has been developed to provide a skill-based educational environment for learners. The Internet of Things training process in the platform was held in a single session with each participant. At the end of the practices, it has been seen that the training carried out on the platform can provide learning at both cognitive and skill levels; the knowledge learned in the virtual reality environment can be transferred to real life and has a lasting effect. Furthermore, it was determined that there was a reverse relationship between the participants’ sense of presence and their cognitive load, and there was a positive relationship between the participants’ sense of presence and their pleasure and arousal levels. It has been concluded that technical data such as frames per second, latency, draw call, and polygon count provided by the platform can have a remarkable effect on the VR experience."
Virtual reality evaluation of the spatial learning strategies in gamers,"Psychological memory tests have traditionally relied on paper-based methods. However, the emergence of virtual reality tools, including adaptations of animal lab tests, has opened up new possibilities for evaluating and enhancing attention and memory processes. The impact of virtual environments on spatial memory remains a topic of ongoing debate. To contribute to this discussion, we conducted a comprehensive study with two primary objectives. Firstly, we aimed to develop a virtual reality tool that could effectively assess search strategies in gamers within virtual environments. To achieve this, we designed a virtual water maze inspired by those used in animal research. Secondly, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving participants to analyze how spatial memory strategies evolve in a virtual environment with increasing gaming experience. The results revealed that participants with more gaming experience exhibited faster and more precise learning in the virtual water maze, along with improved search strategies. Additionally, our study allowed for the evaluation of our software and enabled us to track changes in the efficacy of learning strategies. Overall, this study emphasizes the potential of virtual environments for both evaluation and cognitive stimulation purposes."
Adaptation of virtual reality interfaces to psychological diagnosis and medical rehabilitation applications,"The challenge of increasing the efficiency of virtual reality interfaces in psychological diagnostic and medical rehabilitation applications is addressed. Implementation of a system for external monitoring of the psychoemotional state of users and monitoring the depth of their immersion based on computer vision technologies is proposed. As an illustrative example, adaptation of a rehabilitation procedure based on monitoring head movements and facial activity is described. Implementation of means for adapting virtual reality user interfaces produces some increase in the complexity of developing software and hardware for psychological diagnostic and medical rehabilitation systems, but at the same time expands the scope of their application due to more correct and evidence-based targeted use."
Investigating Educators’ and Students’ Perspectives on Virtual Reality Enhanced Teaching in Preschool,"Recent developments in technology have introduced new tools, such as virtual reality, into the learning process. Although virtual reality appears to be a promising technology for education and has been adopted by a few schools worldwide, we still do not know students’ and educators’ opinions, preferences, and challenges with it, particularly in relation to preschool education. Therefore, this study: (a) analyzes the preferences of 175 children aged 3 to 6 years regarding traditional teaching compared to enhanced teaching with virtual reality and (b) captures educators’ perspectives on virtual reality technology. This evaluation of virtual reality took place in 12 Greek preschool classrooms. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data collection. Specifically, regarding the qualitative data collection, the study included semi-structured interviews with the participating educators, oriented by 2 axes: (a) preschoolers’ motivation and engagement in virtual reality activities, and (b) virtual reality technology prospects and difficulties as an educational tool in a real class. Regarding the quantitative data collection, specially designed questionnaires were used. Bootstrapping was utilized with 1000 samples to strengthen the statistical analysis. The analysis of the students’ responses indicated a statistically significant difference in preference in favor of virtual reality enhanced teaching compared to a traditional method. Statistically significant differences were also observed regarding gender. Furthermore, based on the educators’ answers and comments, difficulties were encountered initially but eventually, virtual reality was regarded as an effective approach for educational purposes. However, concerns arose among educators as to whether this technology could adequately promote preschoolers’ cooperative skills."
NestedChain: “Blockchain-inside-a-Blockchain” new generation prototype,"New developments of blockchain designs, for both research and commercial environments, focus on improving security and energy consumption. Indeed, these implementations are based on managing a single type of information linked to a single blockchain. In this paper, we propose a new design called NestedChain. This proposal creates a system that allows two completely different types of information to be held in the same physical structure, enabling the creation of a blockchain within a blockchain. The new blockchain design can be implemented in various environments where it is necessary to have two different and parallel sets of information in the same network infrastructure. This new conception of blockchain offers a new way to understand the limitations of existing implementations and suggests how the evolution of the blockchain environment could be enhanced."
Advancements in scalability of blockchain infrastructure through IPFS and dual blockchain methodology,"Blockchain technology has gained widespread popularity due to its robust security features, making it an attractive solution for various applications such as cryptocurrency, healthcare, supply chain management, and asset administration. However, limited research has been conducted on the limitations and security issues associated with blockchain technology. In this research article, we focus on the key limitations of blockchain technology, namely, throughput and storage optimization. In this work, we address these issues by designing a faster and less storage-dependent blockchain system while maintaining the security and essential features of blockchain technology. By combining the dual blockchain concept with the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a higher number of transactions can be accommodated within a single block. This leads to amplified throughput and diminished storage requirements. IPFS is harnessed to circumvent storage limitations and enhance overall transaction throughput. Our proposed system is implemented in real-time, resulting in significantly increased throughput and reduced storage requirements. Our findings demonstrate that this system is suitable for use in both cryptocurrencies and real-life applications."
Evolution of blockchain consensus algorithms: a review on the latest milestones of blockchain consensus algorithms,"Blockchain technology has gained widespread adoption in recent years due to its ability to enable secure and transparent record-keeping and data transfer. A critical aspect of blockchain technology is the use of consensus algorithms, which allow distributed nodes in the network to agree on the state of the blockchain. In this review paper, we examine various consensus algorithms that are used in blockchain systems, including proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and hybrid approaches. We go over the trade-offs and factors to think about when choosing a consensus algorithm, such as energy efficiency, decentralization, and security. We also look at the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm as well as their potential impact on the scalability and adoption of blockchain technology."
Kickstarting blockchain: designing blockchain-based tokens for equity crowdfunding,"Blockchain-based tokens seek to overcome the friction and opaqueness of the legacy financial infrastructure in the company funding process, particularly in the early-stage and equity crowdfunding domain. While Initial Coin Offerings and Security Token Offerings proposed a solution for crowdfunding, early-stage companies still face challenges in using blockchain as an alternative equity funding infrastructure. In this context, the idea of blockchain-based equity tokens remains hypothetical. In addition, the literature lacks design theory for the development and implementation of blockchain-based equity tokens. This research bridges this gap by designing, developing, and evaluating an equity token prototype for crowdfunding, following the design science research approach. We propose a refined crowdfunding model and derive seven design principles that contribute to the design theory of equity tokens. The research results show that blockchain-based equity tokens improve efficiency, transparency, and interoperability while meeting regulatory requirements and facilitating secondary market trading."
A scalable blockchain storage scheme for VANET,"Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) make it possible for applications such as autonomous driving, active safety systems and smart cities. As the infrastructure of ITSs, vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) plays a key role in ensuring traffic safety while improving driving experience and comfort. However, VANET faces many challenges as the network is exposed to the public and involves sensitive information such as vehicle control commands and driving records. Although blockchain technology can provide such features as decentralization, immutability, non-reliance on trust and traceability, most of the existing blockchain systems impose high storage and computing capacity requirements for participating nodes while terminals nodes in VANET, such as road-side units (RSUs), on-board units (OBUs) and sensors, usually have very limited storage and computing capacity. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a blockchain system that provides scalable storage capacity for VANETs. The proposed scheme uses network sharding and multi-consensus strategy to improve the topology and consensus process of the blockchain. Aimed at lowering the storage requirement on the RSU nodes that participate in the blockchain, a collaborative storage mechanism and a dynamic copy number strategy for the blockchain ledger is designed. Experimental results show that compared to existing schemes, the proposed scalable blockchain storage scheme can significantly lower the storage requirement for the blockchain nodes, thus making it possible for the nodes with limited storage capacity in VANET to participate in the maintenance of the blockchain to prevent the blockchain from drifting towards centralization, and support maximal sharing of road traffic information while ensuring the security, privacy and trustworthiness of information."

Blockchain-Enabled land management systems,"Land registration system is a very critical component of a revenue department as it holds the record of lands and their owners. In many countries, land records are stored in paper form at centralized locations, making them vulnerable to forgery. Moreover, the centralized system has performance bottleneck, non-transparency, double-spending problems, and a single point of failure. Such issues lead to corruption and conflicts. Recently, Blockchain has been conceived as a technology having the potential to implement and enforce critical security requirements in land revenue systems. With Blockchain, the common issues in revenue systems, such as forgery, falsification, misrepresentation, and human-induced anomalies in records at various levels/stages, can be prevented. The focus of this research is to identify the relationship between Blockchain technology and the land administration system. We discuss issues with current paper-based centralized systems. The potential benefits of Blockchain technology in land management systems are also examined. We present the comparisons of state-of-the-art solutions along with their problems in detail. Finally, research challenges and future directions in Blockchain-enabled land management systems are explored."
Olympus: a GDPR compliant blockchain system,"Blockchain has been gaining significant interest in several domains. However, this technology also raises relevant challenges, namely in terms of data protection. After the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been published by the European Union, companies worldwide changed the way they process personal data. This project provides a model and implementation of a blockchain system to store personal data complying with GDPR. We examine the advantages and challenges and evaluate the system. We use Hyperledger Fabric as blockchain, Interplanetary File System to store personal data off-chain, and a Django REST API to interact with both the blockchain and the distributed file system. Olympus has three possible types of users: Data Subjects, Data Processors and Data Controllers and a fourth participant, Supervisor Authority, that, despite not being an explicit role, can perform all verifications that GDPR mandates. We conclude that it is possible to create a system that overcomes the major challenges of storing personal data in a blockchain (Right to be Forgotten and Right to Rectification), while maintaining its desirable characteristics (auditability, verifiability, tamper resistance, distributed—remove single points of failure) and complying with GDPR."

Salsal: blockchain for vetting cultural object collections,"Many modern cultural object collections suffer from the problem of being obtained in unethical and illegal circumstances. Additionally, information about collections, including their status, object descriptions, and other data need up-to-date information presented to users. We propose a novel blockchain tool called Salsal that enables the vetting of objects, individually or as part of more extensive collections, to meet required ethical and legal guidelines while informing users about relevant information regarding collections. Blockchain provides a better and more rapid way for users to know about collections using a decentralized and immutable ledger technology. Blockchain can be used to incentivize or even pressure collections to vet their objects for ethical and legal guidelines that can benefit the public who use object collections. The prototype software we have made is presented and compared to other blockchains, with code and demonstration provided. We present how our blockchain can enable benefit, providing a useful vetting process for cultural objects, and allowing a user community to contribute to collections in a transparent and secure manner."
Decentralization System Using Smart Blockchain with Secure Hash,"Blockchain decentralization is a reference to decision making and transferring of data control. It is derived as a distributed network from a centralized network, either in an individual, organization, or group. The decentralized system reduces the user’s trust level, which has to be shown by one another. Instead, they confine the functionality of the system network to be degraded. This determines the ability to control the decentralized system using smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a blockchain decentralization system on the smart contracts produced by the blocks. This is called smart blockchain. Smart blockchain or Smart chain is the new generation of blockchain network that allows one or more than a smart contract. The decentralized system of smart contracts here collects the data accurately and flawlessly. The decentralized nature of smart blockchain ensures that there is no single point of control or failure, making it resistant to tampering, hacking, and other malicious activities. Simultaneously this decentralization method helps store and register the data in new blocks. The complete process of a transaction is automatic, without any human interaction. The blockchain used in networks like Ethereum, etc., can be entirely replaced by the smart blockchain or smart chain. The deployment and registration done in smart contracts are overcome with the smart blockchain. We have worked on the four processes in this paper. They are new_block, new_transaction, last_block, and hash. Using the flask framework, the requests are communicated and satisfied on the HTTP Protocol. The further assessment of this decentralized system enabling the smart blockchain can bring a difference in application research, such as Smart Homes using IoT Technology. Smart blockchain technology evaluates security, complexity, privacy, integrity, and implementation protocols. Additionally, we experimentally show the protocols’ outperformance towards multiple blocks of a blockchain."
Data Mesh Meets Blockchain,"Effective dataset management is crucial for enterprises to make informed decisions and remain competitive. However, centralized dataset management approaches often result in poor scalability, unclear governance, inaccessible data silos, and duplication of efforts. This paper proposes a distributed blockchain-based framework inspired by the data mesh architecture to address these challenges. Our proposed framework leverages blockchain’s decentralized nature to enable efficient and transparent dataset sharing across enterprise business domains. By turning datasets into digital assets and business domains into peers, our framework utilizes blockchain smart contracts to allow business domains to view, request, and share datasets. In this paper, we describe the details of our framework, and we analyze it from scalability, accessibility, security, and data governance perspectives. To validate our framework, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation with a publicly available source code."
Quantum blockchain architecture using cyclic QSCD and QKD,"Quantum blockchain (QBC) is a novel decentralised concept anticipated to offer an alternative to the classical blockchain to provide transaction security and transparency. The QBC frameworks can offer the most tangible advantage against the security threat posed by quantum computers on the classical blockchain. The proposed scheme offers a new QBC framework in which voting is performed by the Quantum-Secured Yet Another Consensus (QSYAC) algorithm to create a fast decentralised QBC. QSYAC algorithm is also used to ensure the reliability and fault tolerance of the blockchain framework. The classical information and the chaining are provided using a single qubit state and quantum entanglement. The transactions are signed via a cyclic permutation of the computational distinguishability of the quantum states problem, and quantum key distribution protocol is used for secure key sharing. Assuring the security of the key and the blockchain, the suggested model is more effective and safe from potential quantum assaults than earlier systems."
The Mediating Effect of Self-Efficacy in the Relationship Between Parental Communication and Digital Addiction,"In recent years, the excessive use of digital technologies has led to the emergence of digital addiction at earlier ages. However, studies explaining the causes of digital addiction are limited. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the links between maternal communication, paternal communication, and digital addiction, and whether these relationships were mediated by self-efficacy. It was also tested whether these links were moderated by gender. The data were collected from 601 middle school students aged 11–14 (61.7% girls, Mage = 12.23 SD = 1.03). The participants completed the Digital Addiction Scale for Children, Adolescent Family Process Measure, General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Demographic Questionnaire. Study hypotheses were tested by structural equation modeling. Findings showed that paternal communication was directly associated with self-efficacy, and also indirectly with digital addiction, mediated by self-efficacy. However, maternal communication was only directly associated with digital addiction. Moderation tests by gender were significant. The indirect effect of maternal communication on digital addiction was significant only for girls. The results suggest that the development of programs that will support parents' communication with their children and increase children's self-efficacy may be beneficial in preventing digital addiction. The findings may also help mental health professionals to understand the effects of parent–child communication on children's digital addiction."
Face-to-face more important than digital communication for mental health during the pandemic,"During the lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, many people tried to compensate for limited face-to-face interaction by increasing digital communication. Results of a four-week experience sampling study in the German-speaking countries (N = 411 participants; k = 9791 daily questionnaires) suggest, however, that digital communication was far less relevant for lockdown mental health than face-to-face communication. Digital text-based communication (e.g., e-mail, WhatsApp, SMS) nevertheless was meaningfully associated with mental health, and both face-to-face and digital text communication were more predictive of mental health than either physical or outdoor activity. Our results underscore the importance of face-to-face communication for mental health. Our results also suggest that videoconferencing was only negligibly associated with mental health, despite providing more visual and audible cues than digital text communication."
Emoji as gesture in digital communication: Emoji improve comprehension of indirect speech,"As reliance on digital communication grows, so does the importance of communicating effectively with text. Yet when communicating with text, benefits from other channels, such as hand gesture, are diminished. Hand gestures support comprehension and disambiguate characteristics of the spoken message by providing information in a visual channel supporting speech. Can emoji (pictures used to supplement text communication) perform similar functions? Here, we ask whether emoji improve comprehension of indirect speech. Indirect speech is ambiguous, and appropriate comprehension depends on the receiver decoding context cues, such as hand gesture. We adapted gesture conditions from prior research (Kelly et al., 1999, Experiment 2) to a digital, text-based format, using emoji rather than gestures. Participants interpreted 12 hypothetical text-message exchanges that ended with indirect speech, communicated via text only, text+emoji, or emoji only, in a between-subjects design. Like that previously seen for hand gesture, emoji improved comprehension. Participants were more likely to correctly interpret indirect speech in the emoji-only condition compared with the text+emoji and the text-only conditions, and more likely in the text+emoji condition compared to the text-only condition. Thus, emoji are not mere decoration, but rather are integrated with text to communicate and disambiguate complex messages. Similar to gesture in face-to-face communication, emoji improve comprehension during text-based communication."
Effect of digital literacy on social entrepreneurial intentions and nascent behaviours among students and practitioners in mass communication,"Because journalism and mass communication have changed dramatically in the digital era, exploring alternative career paths for students and practitioners in mass communication may offer valuable insights for the future of the field. Considering the emphasis on decent work opportunities and responsible production practices outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals, this study evaluates the determinants of social entrepreneurial intentions and behaviours of students and practitioners of mass communication in Taiwan. A quantitative survey method is adopted. In total, 814 participants, consisting of 373 students and 441 practitioners, provided valid responses, which were analysed utilising structural equation modelling. The results in both samples indicate positive direct effects of perceived social support, perceived social awareness of peers, and digital literacy on social entrepreneurial intentions, and positive direct effects of digital literacy and social entrepreneurial intentions on social entrepreneurial behaviours. The study identifies digital literacy as a critical element for fostering social entrepreneurial intentions and behaviours. Moreover, educational implications and suggestions are also provided."
The digital power of the tower: digital communication technologies and dwelling experience in residential large urban developments,"Residential large urban developments are the dominant mode of housing development in many cities around the world. They introduce new technologies to the residential setting that reshape the dwelling experience. Using digital ethnography and in-depth interviews with residents of three residential large urban developments at the center of Israel, this paper portrays how the digital dimension is embedded in and reshapes the performance and experience of the housing environment. We argue the centrality of the digital dimension to the emergence of a distinctly different dwelling experience and the transformation of residential power relations in the city."

The experiment shows that the method is accurate in data acquisition, fast in data transmission and high in fault diagnosis accuracy. It is a highly practical intelligent patrol method for power communication equipment."
A Model for Digital Education Management Information System Using Wireless Communication and BP Neural Networks,"With the popularity of wireless communication and different mobile intelligent terminals, digital education management information systems are becoming increasingly popular among students. The problem of modernized teaching has significantly influenced and altered teaching quality evaluation methodologies and models. However, the findings revealed that the existing intelligent teaching quality diagnostic still needs to improve design and execution. As a result, creating an education management information system is critical, and establishing a digital education management information system has become a critical undertaking. To address these problems, this research paper presents a model for a digital education management information system (DEMIS) that utilizes wireless communication and BP neural networks (BPNNs) to manage digital education in schools. The paper highlights the significance of wireless communication and DEMIS in modern education. The study employs a grey prediction model and a BP neural network model to predict the trend of education development. The DEMIS is set up using MATLAB simulation with management constraint parameters, and the sample data originate from 85 instructors’ digital education assessment ratings. The experiment is carried out in two parts: using the grey prediction model and the BPNNs, which verify the suggested method’s efficacy in managing digital education in schools. The experimental findings suggest that, by combining wireless communication and BPNNs, the system can handle the campus network’s information in a unified manner and give decision assistance to managers, which is very practicable. Therefore, the suggested DEMIS may effectively enhance students’ learning experiences and education quality."
"Corporate social responsibility communication in the ICT sector: digital issues, greenwashing, and materiality","Digitalization brings with it new social and governance issues and heightened responsibility, particularly for corporations. In recent years, society has demanded more transparency from companies about digital technology practices, oversight, and impacts. One sector that sharpens the view on these dynamics is information and communication technology (ICT). This study introduces for the first time an examination of corporate social responsibility (CSR) discourse on digital issues among large ICT firms by using signaling theory to analyze a broad set of media (sustainability, ESG, CSR, integrated, impact, purpose, consolidated management, and annual reports as well as issue briefs and webpages). It clarifies how ICT firms present materiality—a reporting concept associated with fair representation and relevance of information—in their CSR reporting on digital topics. It then discusses implications for greenwashing and makes recommendations for improving disclosure credibility.Graphical Abstract"
Tactile Codec with Visual Assistance in Multi-modal Communication for Digital Health,"In the digital health, with the development of communication, medical information in all modalities is growing exponentially. Therefore, an effective communication for multi-modal data including tactile and visual information is paramount. In this paper, we propose a novel method to compress the tactile video data from GelSight sensors for the applications of digital health. Firstly, our method combines the visual and tactile modalities to extract the saliency information for the tactile videos. A target recognition network is designed as the visual assistance, which helps tactile videos to extract the effective information frames by recognizing whether objects are touching or not. Secondly, we design a special coding for inter- and intra-frame prediction to further extract the saliency information and compress the tactile signal. Intra-frame prediction utilizes a dynamic group of pictures (GOP) strategy to reduce time redundancy. And intra-frame prediction based on low-rank sparse decomposition (LRSD) is then used to further achieve efficient compression. Finally, Through extensive evaluation of metrics, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), our method obtains the better results than advanced video coding (AVC) and high efficiency video coding (HEVC). Our method achieves an average bitrate savings of 23.6% compared to HEVC and 61.4% compared to AVC. The results show that the proposed method can greatly compress the amount of haptic data with high reconstruction quality."
Linear digital precoding technology in massive multiple input multiple output wireless communication system,"The rapid development of wireless communication in today's society is facing the development bottleneck of increasingly tense spectrum resources. As the key technology of 5G technology, Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MMIMO) technology has been widely studied and applied in recent years. It is expected to bring progress to wireless communication systems. The key characteristic of MMIMO is its large antenna array that results in a high dimension of the wireless system channel. This article examines the use of precoding technology in large-scale multi-antenna MIMO systems to address the issue of Common Channel Interference (CCI). The study starts by introducing the concept of linear digital precoding and provides mathematical demonstrations of three linear digital precoding schemes. The performance of these schemes is then simulated and analyzed using MATLAB, with the results showing a significant improvement in the bit error performance and combining rate of the MIMO system."
Digital information and communication technologies in political education in universities: conflict of pragmatic and civilizational goals,"The article aims to determine the correspondence of the value orientations of students and teachers to the pragmatic and civilizational goals of political education in the process of introducing digital information and communication technologies for sustainable development. The study involved 92 students of the School of Marxism, TongJi University, who are receiving political education at the master’s level in the speciality “Political Science” using digital mobile and cloud information and communication educational technologies, and 83 teachers of political disciplines of this university. The authors used the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). The accumulation, sorting and visualization of information in the course of the study were carried out in the Microsoft Excel program. The statistical significance and significance of the results of the study were assessed based on the Student’s t-test, which was calculated using the online calculator Social Science Statistics. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences between the motivational educational values of students and teachers have revealed: the teachers expressed conformity largely than the students (4.6 ± 0.2 and 3.4 ± 0.1 points, respectively) and the importance of traditions (4.9 ± 0.1 and 3.5 ± 0.3 points), and the students - independence (4.5 ± 0.2 vs. 3.3 ± 0.1 points). According to the neuroticism scale, the indicators of the teachers (15.6 ± 2.4) are at the upper limit of the norm and statistically significantly (p < 0.05) exceed the hands of the students (10.2 ± 1.0). The difference in the hierarchy of values of students receiving political education using digital information and communication technologies and teachers of political disciplines was revealed, reflecting the presence of a conflict between the pragmatic and civilizational goals of political education in the process of introducing digital information and communication technologies, primarily about the opposition of traditions and universalism, conformism and the desire for power and achievement."
Synchronous restoration of video key frame loss based on digital media communication protocol,"This paper presents a synchronous recovery method for video key frame loss, aiming to analyze the experimental video through digital media feature extraction algorithm. By analyzing and designing effective communication protocols in real-time embedded systems, video data can be better processed. On this basis, key frames are restore synchronously through digital media communication protocol, and verified by comparing with other algorithms. Experimental results shows that the recall and precision of this algorithm for key frame extraction are 90.1% and 100% respectively, Among the three algorithms compared, the recall and precision of video key frame extraction based on single feature algorithm are the highest, 80.2% and 85.9% respectively. At the same time, the synchronization restoration time of this algorithm for lost key frames is 12.2 s, which took less time than other algorithms. It can be seen that the algorithm based on digital media feature extraction is of great significance for synchronous restoration of video key frame loss. It can be seen that the algorithm based on digital media feature extraction is of great significance for the synchronous recovery of video key frame loss, and can effectively promote the development of video data diversity and the improvement of information interaction. Under the digital media communication protocol, it can effectively synchronize the audio and video receiving end of multimedia information, and then recover and predict the lost frames in the video sequence. First, it can enhance the internal characteristics of video frames and the similarity and consistency of images between frames. Secondly, it can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of video data processing. Finally, from the perspective of practical development, the synchronous recovery of video key frame loss based on digital media communication protocol can effectively promote the sustainable development of media data, which has certain social value and practical significance in the current era of big data."
"Digital communication strategies used by private companies, entrepreneurs, and public entities to attract long-stay tourists: a review","Globalization and the changes in the technological and social industries have facilitated international mobility in such a way that the distinctions between tourism and other forms of mobility closer to migration have practically become blurred. Improvements in digital communication have promoted people’s search for a better quality of life in terms of health, work, leisure, and other aspects. New forms of communication have started to gradually displace the more conventional media.

Effects of robot-assisted digital storytelling on hospitalized children’s communication during the COVID-19 pandemic,"This study proposed a robot-assisted digital storytelling approach to reduce hospitalized children’s anxiety about intravenous injections and to improve their therapeutic communication and therapeutic engagement. In order to verify the effectiveness of the robot-assisted digital storytelling approach, a randomized controlled study was implemented. A total of 47 children from a regional hospital were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 21) and a control group (n = 26). The experimental group adopted the robot-assisted digital storytelling approach in health education for intravenous injections, while the control group received video-based health education. The study results indicated that the proposed robot-assisted digital storytelling approach not only reduced the children’s anxiety, but also had positive effects on children’s communication about intravenous injections, emotions during hospitalization, and therapeutic engagement. As a consequence, it is suggested that educators and researchers consider adopting robot-assisted digital storytelling to facilitate nursing clinical health education for children."
Internet of things connecting digital world through visible light communication,"This study focuses on the use of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) for lighting, incorporating Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology for data transmission. The Internet of Things (IoT), an inventive technology can connect physical objects to the digital world through VLC. In smart environments, IoT interacts with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET), enhancing user experience and economic viability.

"Invasiveness, Intrusiveness and Influence: three new metrics to measure communication between political digital echo chambers","The contemporary debate about the place and role of political digital echo chambers (DPECs) in political communication relies more on assumptions, guess work, and speculations rather than empirical conclusions. Such shortcomings reflect the lack of empirical tools to measure the communication between echo chambers and the outside world. We try to overcome this deficiency by construing three graph-level metrics: Invasiveness, Intrusiveness and Influence, which try to capture the information dominance of a DPEC over another one, its strength of information source, and the penetration capability of one DPEC’s message into another DPEC’s space. We tested our metrics with simulated and real network data, and they seem to respond according to their design and our expectations. Test results on real network data showed that our metrics would be very useful in measuring the comparative strength of political mobilization in face of opposing forces that use the same social networks for political countermobilization."
Digital Development of Cultural and Creative Industries Under the Security of 5G Mobile and Communication,"With the rapid growth of global 5G technology, it inevitably has a certain impact on the growth of China’s cultural industry, and also encourages employees in the cultural industry to innovate and transform China’s cultural industry. Various technologies of 5G digital technology have important influence and strong impetus on cultural & creative industries. With the rapid progress of social development, people are gradually attracted by some new things, new media and other forms of content, and their attention to cultural legacy is gradually reduced, which in turn brings a large number of cultural relics, historical buildings, cultural relics, handicrafts, etc. that slowly disappear from people’s vision. Under the background of 5G mobile and communication security, this article proposes a digital protection model of cultural legacy based on deep learning (DL). The digital protection model of cultural legacy based on DL can effectively solve the problem of unclear and stereo images, while maintaining the clarity of cultural legacy images, which provides theoretical support for the digital growth of cultural & creative industries."

Healthcare professionals satisfaction and AI-based clinical decision support system in public sector hospitals during health crises: a cross-sectional study,"The entire world’s focus has shifted to a digital health management system after the COVID-19 pandemic and crisis management through information systems that provide potential health support and minimize the effects of similar healthcare emergencies. Artificial intelligence (AI) can create alternative techniques such as Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), which can aid complex scenarios such as large volumes of data, information accuracy, patient turnover, and health management regimes. CDSS uses an AI-based health information system that is helpful, fast, effective, and offers advanced techniques in emergencies and pandemics such as COVID-19. Therefore, it is essential to analyze mechanisms that can influence the degree of health care professionals (HCP) satisfaction and intention to adopt CDSS. Based on DeLone and McLean’s information system success model (D&M and ISSM), the researchers recruited 237 on-duty HCP from three major hospitals in Wuhan, China, in 2021. Data is collected through an online survey questionnaire with the consent of the hospital administration. The empirical findings show the strong influence of IS qualities (system, information, and service quality) and user satisfaction. These findings support the foundation for CDSS adoption in developing countries."
Role of Regulatory Sandboxes and MLOps for AI-Enabled Public Sector Services,"This paper discusses how innovations in public sector AI-based services must comply with the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) regulatory frameworks while enabling experimentation and participation of diverse stakeholders throughout the Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle. The paper examines the implications of the emerging regulation, AI regulatory sandboxes and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) as tools that facilitate compliance while enabling co-learning and active participation of multiple stakeholders. We propose a framework that fosters experimentation with automation pipelines and continuous monitoring for the deployment of future public sector AI-based services in a regulatory-compliant and technically innovative manner. AI regulatory sandboxes can be beneficial as a space for contained experimentation that goes beyond regulatory considerations to specific experimentation with the implementation of ML frameworks. While the paper presents a framework based on emerging regulations, tools and practices pertaining to the responsible use of AI, this must be validated through pilot experimentation with public and private stakeholders and regulators in different areas of high-risk AI-based services."
aiWATERS: an artificial intelligence framework for the water sector,"The presence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications has led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains. AI is making its way into industry, beyond research and academia. Concurrently, the water sector is undergoing a digital transformation. Water utilities in the United States are at different stages in their journey of digital transformation, and the decision makers in water sector, who are non-expert stakeholders in AI applications, need to better understand this technology to make informed decisions. While AI has numerous benefits to offer, there are also many challenges related to data, model development, knowledge integration and ethical concerns that should be considered before implementing it for real world applications. Civil engineering is a licensed profession where critical decision making is involved. Therefore, trust in any decision support technology is critical for its acceptance in real-world applications. Therefore, this research proposes a framework called aiWATERS (Artificial Intelligence for the Water Sector) which can serve as a guide for the water utilities to successfully implement AI in their system. Based on this framework, we conduct pilot interviews and surveys with various small, medium, and large water utilities in the United States (US) to capture their current state of AI implementation and identify the challenges faced by them. The research findings reveal that most of the water utilities in the United States are at an early stage of implementing AI as they face concerns regarding the black box nature, trustworthiness, and sustainability of AI technology in their system. The aiWATERS framework is intended to help the utilities navigate through these issues in their journey of digital transformation."
Awareness among teaching on AI and ML applications based on fuzzy in education sector at USA,"This paper summarises the level of knowledge held by educators in the United States on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the classroom. The education industry seems to have reaped little benefits from the AI & ML industry's growth thus far. In any event, the creation of new ML & AI-based systems is mostly aimed towards areas with higher societal needs, such as medical diagnostics and individual transportation, rather than institutions of higher education. With this analysis, we want to shed some light on the mysterious state of application development in the US education industry. The report was written using a triangulation of research approaches to achieve this objective. First, we surveyed the current state-of-the-art reports from other countries and reviewed the relevant literature on AI & ML applications in the field of education. In the second phase, we analysed, to the extent possible, official documents from the United States education sector that dealt with AI and ML based on fuzzy digitalization initiatives. Third, in order to corroborate and expand upon the impressions received from the relevant literature and the document analysis, 15 guideline-based expert interviews were undertaken. Based on this data, we provide a selection of the AI & ML systems in use in universities and colleges now, analyse the benefits and drawbacks of implementing them, and speculate on their potential future evolution. While it would be a stretch to say that this paper presents a comprehensive overview of the subject, it does provide light on key areas of application and potential future research directions for AI and ML."
A global perspective on data powering responsible AI solutions in health applications,"Healthcare AI solutions have the potential to transform access, quality of care, and improve outcomes for patients globally. This review suggests consideration of a more global perspective, with a particular focus on marginalized communities, during the development of healthcare AI solutions. The review focuses on one aspect (medical applications) to allow technologists to build solutions in today’s environment with an understanding of the challenges they face. The following sections explore and discuss the current challenges in the underlying data and AI technology design on healthcare solutions for global deployment. We highlight some of the factors that lead to gaps in data, gaps around regulations for the healthcare sector, and infrastructural challenges in power and network connectivity, as well as lack of social systems for healthcare and education, which pose challenges to the potential universal impacts of such technologies. We recommend using these considerations in developing prototype healthcare AI solutions to better capture the needs of a global population."
An example of governance for AI in health services from Aotearoa New Zealand,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undergoing rapid development, meaning that potential risks in application are not able to be fully understood. Multiple international principles and guidance documents have been published to guide the implementation of AI tools in various industries, including healthcare practice. In Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) we recognised that the challenge went beyond simply adapting existing risk frameworks and governance guidance to our specific health service context and population. We also deemed prioritising the voice of Māori (the indigenous people of Aotearoa NZ) a necessary aspect of honouring Te Tiriti (the Treaty of Waitangi), as well as prioritising the needs of healthcare service users and their families. Here we report on the development and establishment of comprehensive and effective governance over the development and implementation of AI tools within a health service in Aotearoa NZ. The implementation of the framework in practice includes testing with real-world proposals and ongoing iteration and refinement of our processes."
Operationalising AI ethics through the agile software development lifecycle: a case study of AI-enabled mobile health applications,"Although numerous ethical principles and guidelines have been proposed to guide the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it has proven difficult to translate these principles into actionable practices beyond mere adherence to ethical ideas. This is particularly challenging in the context of AI systems for healthcare, which requires balancing the potential benefits of the solution against the risks to patients and the wider community, including minorities and underserved populations. To address this challenge, we propose a shift from one-size-fits-all ethical principles to contextualized case-based ethical frameworks. This study uses an AI-enabled mHealth application as a case study. Our framework is built on existing ethical guidelines and principles, including the AI4People framework, the EU High-Level Expert Group on trustworthy AI, and wider human rights considerations. Additionally, we incorporate relational perspectives to address human value concerns and moral tensions between individual rights and public health. Our approach is based on ”ethics by design,” where ethical principles are integrated throughout the entire AI development pipeline, ensuring that ethical considerations are not an afterthought but implemented from the beginning. For our case study, we identified 7 ethical principles: fairness, agility, precision, safeguarding humanity, respect for others, trust and accountability, and robustness and reproducibility. We believe that the best way to mitigate and address ethical consequences is by implementing ethical principles in the software development processes that developers commonly use. Finally, we provide examples of how our case-based framework can be applied in practice, using examples of AI-driven mobile applications in healthcare."
"Does AI-technology-based indoor environmental quality impact occupants’ psychological, physiological health, and productivity?","Over the past century, because of increased global travel, there high growth in the travel and tourism sector. But the outbreak of an ongoing pandemic has changed this scenario, which has put tremendous focus on the Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) embedded with the application of technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI). This study aims to investigate the effect of AI-technology-based IEQ in the hospitality industry on occupants’ productivity through their psychological and physiological health. Drawing from Job demand - resource theory and Nudging philosophy, we formulated the hypothesis and conceptual model, which was empirically tested by structural equation modeling (SEM). The results show that AI-technology-based IEQ is statistically significant in people’s behavioral change, which reflects on occupants’ health and productivity. Notably, AI-technology-based IEQ of the hospitality industry had a greater influence on occupants’ productivity, followed by their psychological and physiological health."
Applying the ethics of AI: a systematic review of tools for developing and assessing AI-based systems,"Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems and their increasingly common use have made it a ubiquitous technology; Machine Learning algorithms are present in streaming services, social networks, and in the health sector. However, implementing this emerging technology carries significant social and ethical risks and implications. Without ethical development of such systems, there is the potential for this technology to undermine people’s autonomy, privacy, and equity, even affecting human rights. Considering the approaches necessary for ethical development and effective governance of AI, such as ethical principles, guidelines, and technical tools, the question arises regarding the limitations of implementing these measures by the highly technical personnel involved in the process. In this context, we propose the creation of a typology that distinguishes the different stages of the AI life-cycle, the high-level ethical principles that should govern their implementation, and the tools with the potential to foster compliance with these principles, encompassing both technical and conceptual resources. In addition, this typology will include relevant information such as developmental level, related tasks, sectors, and language. Our research is based on a systematic review in which we identified 352 resources and tools. We expect this contribution to be valuable in promoting ethical AI development for developers and leaders who manage these initiatives. The complete typology and the comprehensive list of resources are available for consultation at https://ricardo-ob.github.io/tools4responsibleai."

A Review on Solar Photovoltaic System Efficiency Improving Technologies,"AbstractThe use of solar energy-based technologies has sparked increased interest in recent years to meet our society’s various energy demands. Photovoltaic (PV) cell efficiency is improved, and low-grade heat is generated by combining a PV and thermal system into a single unit. Researchers are working on improving the PVT system for the past two–three decades, but only a few effective PVT systems are currently available on the consumer scale. This paper reviews various tracking and cooling techniques that are being used to track maximum sun radiations and decrease the probability of increased temperature when attempting for improving PV solar panel performance. So, many research papers have been analyzed and classified based on their emphasis, contribution, and the technologies used to perform PV panel tracking and cooling. This research would be beneficial to new researchers who are interested in working in this area and technology."
A Detailed Review on Wind and Solar Hybrid Green Energy Technologies for Sustainable Smart Cities,"Smart City development is a program for urban redevelopment and refurbishment. The main goal of a smart city is to stimulate economic growth and improve the quality of life of people by facilitating local area development and utilizing technology, particularly technology that leads to Smart results. Power generation is also a very crucial factor in the power management of smart cities. Most developing countries still use non-renewable energy sources as their conventional ones for power generation. The important problems arising from Non-Renewable energy sources are the depletion of natural resources, incremental greenhouse gases, pollution of the environment, and the rising cost of power consumption. Nowadays, the people and government are becoming more conscious of the significance of switching from conventional energy sources to renewable energy sources as we become more mindful of our impact on the environment. Green Energy or Renewable Energy is a way to make our Smart cities and Power Grid more sustainable. Hydroelectric, Solar, Tidal, Wind, and Bio-gas are a few of the important green energy sources used for power generation. Solar and wind power harvesting can be adopted and more suited for the Smart city-like urban environment. Since solar radiation and wind speed change throughout the year, neither a solar nor a wind-powered system can offer consistent electricity individually. By considering this condition, hybrid solar and wind power harvesting is suggested for sustainable Smart future cities. The present work explains solar power, wind power, and hybrid solar-wind power harvesting in detail with a Smart City power generation perspective."
A review of advanced architectural glazing technologies for solar energy conversion and intelligent daylighting control,"Efficient management of solar radiation through architectural glazing is a key strategy for achieving a comfortable indoor environment with minimum energy consumption. Conventional glazing consisting of a single or multiple glass pane(s) exhibits high visible light transmittance and solar heat gain coefficient, which can be a double-edged sword, i.e., it allows sufficient sunlight to enter the building interior space for passive heating and lighting; on the other hand, it can cause glare discomfort and large cooling energy consumption. Among the various advanced glazing technologies being developed, Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) glazing has a prominent position due to its ability to reduce cooling load and visual discomfort while simultaneously generating electricity from sunlight. Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in low-concentration optics such as Dielectric based Compound Parabolic Concentrators (DiCPCs), with a growing interest in the development of Building Integrated Concentrating Photovoltaic (BICPV) glazing to improve light harvesting and electric power output. One of the challenges faced by traditional BIPV glazing systems is the lack of dynamic control over daylight and solar heat transmission to cope with variations in weather conditions and seasonal heating/cooling demands of buildings. A promising solution is to integrate an optically switchable smart material into a BIPV glazing system, which enables dynamic daylighting control in addition to solar power conversion. Thermotropic (TT) hydrogel materials such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) and Hydroxypropyl Cellulose (HPC) are potential candidates for hybrid BIPV smart glazing applications, due to their unique features such as high visible transparency (in the clear state), strong light-scattering capability (in the translucent state) and large solar energy modulation. This paper reviews various types of electricity-generating glazing technologies including BIPV glazing and BICPV glazing, as well as smart glazing technologies with a particular focus on TT hydrogel integrated glazing. The characteristics, benefits and limitations of hybrid BIPV smart glazing are also evaluated. Finally, the challenges and research opportunities in this emerging field are discussed."
Integration of multi-criteria decision-making for performance evaluation of different solar batteries technologies,"The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach allowing the improvement of the operation, the performances and the lifetime of a photovoltaic system. This improvement concerns the energy storage system, and it is essentially ensured by a multi-criteria analysis integrating the dependability analysis tools. In this context, this approach is based on an evaluation focused on several selection criteria and several technical factors to properly determine the most relevant technology for solar batteries such as lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium battery (Ni–Cd), nickel–metal hydride (Ni–MH) battery and lithium-ion battery. The factors that are taken into account by the authors in this multi-criteria analysis are reliability, security, size and cost. The assessment of the reliability of the available battery capacity is established using failure modes, effects and criticality analysis and a classification of failure modes by an appropriate calculation of the number risk priority (RPN). The analysis of the security criteria is based on the development of a preliminary risk analysis which shows the impact of different solar technologies batteries on the environment, human health and physical. This approach is also interested in the evaluation of the cost and the impact of the volume, the number and the mass of the batteries used in the photovoltaic system. Finally, this approach is completed by the utilization of the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) to develop a decision-making model and solve the problem of choosing solar battery technology."
An Extensive Analysis of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC),"In the 1800s, as the primary energy resource, the industrial revolution started with fossil fuels. Various research efforts have been carried out in finding an alternative for photovoltaic devices to traditional silicon (Si)-based solar cells.

A Review on p-Type Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) Solar Cell,"The primary objectives of solar cell technology are high efficiency, long durability, mass manufacturing, cost effectiveness, and the use of environmentally benign components. Among high-efficiency crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based solar cell types, tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells have attracted particular attention because of a multitude of advantages. These include easy processing, high efficiency potential, and availability of raw materials. Due to cheaper wafer pricing, easily compatible with advanced and long-tested PERC solar cell manufacturing process, fabrication of TOPCon solar cells starting with p-type c-Si wafers are significantly more demanding from the standpoint of mass production of solar module. If cutting-edge high-efficiency technologies were used in industrial production, the quality of the p-type wafer may eventually become a bottleneck. Recent production lines elsewhere have developed p-type TOPCon solar cells with 25.19% conversion efficiency using monocrystalline Czochralski (CZ) c-Si wafers. This effectively proves the outstanding viability of p-type TOPCon solar cells for an industrial scale. This review article comprehensively discusses the history of high-efficiency p-type TOPCon solar cells, advancement in various areas to increase effective cell performance, state of commercialization, as well as potential future research opportunities and challenges."
Performance evaluation of monocrystalline and polycrystalline-based solar cell,"This paper exhibits the performance of crystalline-based solar cells (polycrystalline and monocrystalline) as well as the comparative analysis of these solar cells following various types of orientation in the solar plant. Since the global energy demand is increasing rapidly, different sorts of renewable energy have been used in the last decades to meet this massive demand all over the world. From recent studies, solar has been considered the most promising among these renewable sources. To analyze the performance, the geographical site (Savar, Dhaka) was selected which has a latitude of 23.8538° and a longitude of 90.2534°. In this study, the most effective polycrystalline and monocrystalline solar cell has been founded which is 440 and 370 wp, respectively. Regarding this, a grid-connected PV system (12.3 Kwp) has been simulated which showed the performance ratio of the monocrystalline cell was 83.55%, which was better than the polycrystalline-based solar cell which was 79.6%. In terms of different kinds of orientations, monocrystalline at dual-axis tracking planes showed the highest value of energy injection to the grid was 25.8 MWh/year, while the least value has been founded in the fixed orientation plane which was 20.6 MWh/year. In this perspective, polycrystalline showed 23.9 and 19.5 MWh/year for dual-axis tracking and fixed orientation planes, respectively. Monocrystalline showed more energy injected into the grid compared to polycrystalline technologies for every orientation in the plant as well as the highest value of performance ratio."
Blurring the lines: how AI is redefining artistic ownership and copyright,"The rapid advancement of AI technology has brought about significant changes across various industries, including the realm of art and creative endeavors. Presently, AI demonstrates the capability to produce high-quality works that closely resemble those crafted by humans. However, amidst these advancements, ownership rights remain ambiguous, given that existing copyright laws do not explicitly confer copyright protection to works not originating from human creators. The primary objective of this research is to present a spectrum of opinions and perspectives on a pivotal question: should the ownership of AI-generated works belong to individuals or AI entities? Simultaneously, the study aims to scrutinize the suitability of the existing copyright laws in addressing the complexities of AI-generated works. Additionally, this research paper endeavors to pinpoint the necessary adjustments and enhancements required within the current legal framework to harmonize with the contemporary landscape. To attain these objectives, two surveys were conducted. The first, a quantitative survey, involved a sample size of 100 participants, while the second, a qualitative survey, featured professionals within the creative field and legal experts. Each group comprised five individuals. The research findings gleaned from these surveys strongly suggest that AI-generated works exhibit quality on par with human creations and, therefore, merit classification as human works. Furthermore, there is a compelling argument that these works should be afforded copyright protection to provide clarity regarding their utilization by other individuals. Consequently, the prevailing copyright laws should undergo revision and amendment to reflect the demands of the modern era, establishing precise regulations tailored for AI-generated works."
Computer-aided digital media art creation based on artificial intelligence,"Driven by information technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually become an important symbol of modern society. In digital media art creation, AI has unique advantages and can help artists create better works. The purpose of this research was to study digital media art creation based on AI’s computer-aided technology. This study analysed the possibility of combining digital media art with AI and the positive effects of combining it with digital media art creation are discussed. A support vector machine (SVM) algorithm based on AI is proposed, and computer-aided digital media art creation based on AI was analysed experimentally. The experimental results of this study showed that artistic works created based on AI computer-aided technology had a digital dynamic score of 80 to 90, a digital sound effect score of 82 to 92, a digital stunt score of 85 to 95, a digital texture score of 83 to 96, and a digital colour score of 86 to 93. These scores were higher than those of works of art created based on traditional technology, indicating that AI-based computer-aided technology can be well applied to the creation of digital media art."
Using machine learning to predict artistic styles: an analysis of trends and the research agenda,"In the field of art, machine learning models have been used to predict artistic styles in paintings. The foregoing is somewhat advantageous for analysts, as these tools can provide more valuable results and help reduce bias in the results and conclusions provided. Therefore, the objective of this research was to examine research trends in the use of machine learning to predict artistic styles from a bibliometric review based on the PRISMA methodology. From the search equations, 268 documents were found, out of which, following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 128 documents were analyzed. Through quantitative analysis, a growing research interest in the subject is evident, progressing from user perception approaches to the utilization of tools like deep learning for art studies. Among the main results, it is possible to identify that one of the most used techniques in the field has been neural networks for pattern recognition. Also, a large part of the research focuses on the use of design software for image creation and manipulation. Finally, it is found that the number of studies focused on contemporary modern art is still limited, this is due to the fact that a large part of the investigations has focused on historical artistic styles."
Creation mechanism of new media art combining artificial intelligence and internet of things technology in a metaverse environment,"The Metaverse is regarded as a brand-new virtual society constructed by deep media, and the new media art produced by new media technology will gradually replace the traditional art form and play an important role in the infinite Metaverse in the future. The maturity of the new media art creation mechanism must also depend on the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The purpose of this study is to explore the image style transfer of digital painting art in new media art, that is, to reshape the image style by neural network technology in AI based on retaining the semantic information of the original image. Based on neural style transfer, an image style conversion method based on feature synthesis is proposed. Using the feature mapping of content image and style image and combining the advantages of traditional texture synthesis, a richer multi-style target feature mapping is synthesized. Then, the inverse transformation of target feature mapping is restored to an image to realize style transformation. In addition, the research results are analyzed. Under the background of integrating AI and IoT, the creation mechanism of new media art is optimized. Regarding digital art style transformation, the Tensorflow program framework is used for simulation verification and performance evaluation. The experimental results show that the image style transfer method based on feature synthesis proposed in this study can make the image texture more reasonably distributed, and can change the style texture by retaining more semantic structure content of the original image, thus generating richer artistic effects, and having better interactivity and local controllability. It can provide theoretical help and reference for developing new media art creation mechanisms."
Humans versus AI: whether and why we prefer human-created compared to AI-created artwork,"With the recent proliferation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models capable of mimicking human artworks, AI creations might soon replace products of human creativity, although skeptics argue that this outcome is unlikely. One possible reason this may be unlikely is that, independent of the physical properties of art, we place great value on the imbuement of the human experience in art. An interesting question, then, is whether and why people might prefer human-compared to AI-created artworks. To explore these questions, we manipulated the purported creator of pieces of art by randomly assigning a “Human-created” or “AI-created” label to paintings actually created by AI, and then assessed participants’ judgements of the artworks across four rating criteria (Liking, Beauty, Profundity, and Worth). Study 1 found increased positive judgements for human- compared to AI-labelled art across all criteria. Study 2 aimed to replicate and extend Study 1 with additional ratings (Emotion, Story, Meaningful, Effort, and Time to create) intended to elucidate why people more-positively appraise Human-labelled artworks. The main findings from Study 1 were replicated, with narrativity (Story) and perceived effort behind artworks (Effort) moderating the label effects (“Human-created” vs. “AI-created”), but only for the sensory-level judgements (Liking, Beauty). Positive personal attitudes toward AI moderated label effects for more-communicative judgements (Profundity, Worth). These studies demonstrate that people tend to be negatively biased against AI-created artworks relative to purportedly human-created artwork, and suggest that knowledge of human engagement in the artistic process contributes positively to appraisals of art."
Copyright and Artificial Creation: Does EU Copyright Law Protect AI-Assisted Output?,"This article queries whether and to what extent works produced with the aid of AI systems – AI-assisted output – are protected under EU copyright standards. We carry out a doctrinal legal analysis to scrutinise the concepts of “work”, “originality” and “creative freedom”, as well as the notion of authorship, as set forth in the EU copyright acquis and developed in the case-law of the Court of Justice. On this basis, we develop a four-step test to assess whether AI-assisted output qualifies as an original work of authorship under EU law, and how the existing rules on authorship may apply. Our conclusion is that current EU copyright rules are generally suitable and sufficiently flexible to deal with the challenges posed by AI-assisted output."
Artistic representations of data can help bridge the US political divide over climate change,"Visual art has been used to revamp the portrayal of climate change with the aims of engaging emotions and expanding nonexperts’ psychological capacity to perceive its relevance. However, empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of artistic representation of data as a tool for public communication is lacking. Using controlled experiments with two national samples of U.S. adults (total N = 671), here we found that artistic visualizations elicited stronger positive emotions than informationally equivalent data graphs but did not differ in their perceived credibility or effectiveness as visual aids for learning. When used to prompt individual reflection, artistic visualizations appeared to mitigate the political division in viewers’ perceived relevance of climate change that could otherwise be exacerbated by exposure to data graphs."
A New Study of AI Artists for Changing the Movie Industries,"Due to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in the arts, this paper aims to explore the use of AI for reducing film production costs through the creation of realistic images. Additionally, we investigate whether AI can recreate the same character at the same age. Without needing to replace the original actor, qualitative data collection tools were employed to study three distinct population groups within the film industry: film industry professionals, moviegoers, and technologists. Our research reveals that AI, or AI artists in film production, still face limitations in significantly reducing production costs. Furthermore, it is crucial to engage a text expert in the image production process for films who possesses a comprehensive understanding of film principles in order to achieve images that align with the project’s requirements. Moreover, the introduction of the AI artist technique allows for the recreation of a character at the same age portrayed by the same actor, even if that actor may have passed away. Consequently, obtaining consent from the relatives of the actor or actress becomes a necessary step. Furthermore, the aspect of audience acceptance does not hold significant interest, as it demands a greater level of realism in both the image and the actors, surpassing what AI can provide. Therefore, this paper underscores the increasing influence of AI in the arts, particularly within film production, and examines its potential to reduce costs and recreate characters."
Recent progress in organic waste recycling materials for solar cell applications,"Organic waste-derived solar cells (OWSC) are a classification of third-generation photovoltaic cells in which one or more constituents are fabricated from organic waste material.

Socio-economic impacts of solar energy technologies for sustainable green energy: a review,"Although fossil fuels leave environmentally hazardous gases like carbon dioxide, to date, global energy production is mostly dependent on these sources. Depletion of fossil resource and changes in the price make it a major concert for the sustainable use in future and utilization of energy resources which is environmentally safe and sustainable. Therefore, an increase in the use natural sustainable energy like solar power observed to be increased recently.

A Review on Solar Photovoltaic System Efficiency Improving Technologies,"AbstractThe use of solar energy-based technologies has sparked increased interest in recent years to meet our society’s various energy demands. Photovoltaic (PV) cell efficiency is improved, and low-grade heat is generated by combining a PV and thermal system into a single unit. Researchers are working on improving the PVT system for the past two–three decades, but only a few effective PVT systems are currently available on the consumer scale. This paper reviews various tracking and cooling techniques that are being used to track maximum sun radiations and decrease the probability of increased temperature when attempting for improving PV solar panel performance. So, many research papers have been analyzed and classified based on their emphasis, contribution, and the technologies used to perform PV panel tracking and cooling. This research would be beneficial to new researchers who are interested in working in this area and technology."
A Detailed Review on Wind and Solar Hybrid Green Energy Technologies for Sustainable Smart Cities,"Smart City development is a program for urban redevelopment and refurbishment. The main goal of a smart city is to stimulate economic growth and improve the quality of life of people by facilitating local area development and utilizing technology, particularly technology that leads to Smart results. Power generation is also a very crucial factor in the power management of smart cities. Most developing countries still use non-renewable energy sources as their conventional ones for power generation. The important problems arising from Non-Renewable energy sources are the depletion of natural resources, incremental greenhouse gases, pollution of the environment, and the rising cost of power consumption. Nowadays, the people and government are becoming more conscious of the significance of switching from conventional energy sources to renewable energy sources as we become more mindful of our impact on the environment. Green Energy or Renewable Energy is a way to make our Smart cities and Power Grid more sustainable. Hydroelectric, Solar, Tidal, Wind, and Bio-gas are a few of the important green energy sources used for power generation. Solar and wind power harvesting can be adopted and more suited for the Smart city-like urban environment. Since solar radiation and wind speed change throughout the year, neither a solar nor a wind-powered system can offer consistent electricity individually. By considering this condition, hybrid solar and wind power harvesting is suggested for sustainable Smart future cities. The present work explains solar power, wind power, and hybrid solar-wind power harvesting in detail with a Smart City power generation perspective."
Integration of multi-criteria decision-making for performance evaluation of different solar batteries technologies,"The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach allowing the improvement of the operation, the performances and the lifetime of a photovoltaic system. This improvement concerns the energy storage system, and it is essentially ensured by a multi-criteria analysis integrating the dependability analysis tools. In this context, this approach is based on an evaluation focused on several selection criteria and several technical factors to properly determine the most relevant technology for solar batteries such as lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium battery (Ni–Cd), nickel–metal hydride (Ni–MH) battery and lithium-ion battery. The factors that are taken into account by the authors in this multi-criteria analysis are reliability, security, size and cost. The assessment of the reliability of the available battery capacity is established using failure modes, effects and criticality analysis and a classification of failure modes by an appropriate calculation of the number risk priority (RPN). The analysis of the security criteria is based on the development of a preliminary risk analysis which shows the impact of different solar technologies batteries on the environment, human health and physical. This approach is also interested in the evaluation of the cost and the impact of the volume, the number and the mass of the batteries used in the photovoltaic system. Finally, this approach is completed by the utilization of the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) to develop a decision-making model and solve the problem of choosing solar battery technology."
A Review on p-Type Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) Solar Cell,"The primary objectives of solar cell technology are high efficiency, long durability, mass manufacturing, cost effectiveness, and the use of environmentally benign components. Among high-efficiency crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based solar cell types, tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells have attracted particular attention because of a multitude of advantages. These include easy processing, high efficiency potential, and availability of raw materials. Due to cheaper wafer pricing, easily compatible with advanced and long-tested PERC solar cell manufacturing process, fabrication of TOPCon solar cells starting with p-type c-Si wafers are significantly more demanding from the standpoint of mass production of solar module. If cutting-edge high-efficiency technologies were used in industrial production, the quality of the p-type wafer may eventually become a bottleneck. Recent production lines elsewhere have developed p-type TOPCon solar cells with 25.19% conversion efficiency using monocrystalline Czochralski (CZ) c-Si wafers. This effectively proves the outstanding viability of p-type TOPCon solar cells for an industrial scale. This review article comprehensively discusses the history of high-efficiency p-type TOPCon solar cells, advancement in various areas to increase effective cell performance, state of commercialization, as well as potential future research opportunities and challenges."
A review of advanced architectural glazing technologies for solar energy conversion and intelligent daylighting control,"Efficient management of solar radiation through architectural glazing is a key strategy for achieving a comfortable indoor environment with minimum energy consumption. Conventional glazing consisting of a single or multiple glass pane(s) exhibits high visible light transmittance and solar heat gain coefficient, which can be a double-edged sword, i.e., it allows sufficient sunlight to enter the building interior space for passive heating and lighting; on the other hand, it can cause glare discomfort and large cooling energy consumption. Among the various advanced glazing technologies being developed, Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) glazing has a prominent position due to its ability to reduce cooling load and visual discomfort while simultaneously generating electricity from sunlight. Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in low-concentration optics such as Dielectric based Compound Parabolic Concentrators (DiCPCs), with a growing interest in the development of Building Integrated Concentrating Photovoltaic (BICPV) glazing to improve light harvesting and electric power output. One of the challenges faced by traditional BIPV glazing systems is the lack of dynamic control over daylight and solar heat transmission to cope with variations in weather conditions and seasonal heating/cooling demands of buildings. A promising solution is to integrate an optically switchable smart material into a BIPV glazing system, which enables dynamic daylighting control in addition to solar power conversion. Thermotropic (TT) hydrogel materials such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) and Hydroxypropyl Cellulose (HPC) are potential candidates for hybrid BIPV smart glazing applications, due to their unique features such as high visible transparency (in the clear state), strong light-scattering capability (in the translucent state) and large solar energy modulation. This paper reviews various types of electricity-generating glazing technologies including BIPV glazing and BICPV glazing, as well as smart glazing technologies with a particular focus on TT hydrogel integrated glazing. The characteristics, benefits and limitations of hybrid BIPV smart glazing are also evaluated. Finally, the challenges and research opportunities in this emerging field are discussed."
Performance evaluation of monocrystalline and polycrystalline-based solar cell,"This paper exhibits the performance of crystalline-based solar cells (polycrystalline and monocrystalline) as well as the comparative analysis of these solar cells following various types of orientation in the solar plant. Since the global energy demand is increasing rapidly, different sorts of renewable energy have been used in the last decades to meet this massive demand all over the world. From recent studies, solar has been considered the most promising among these renewable sources. To analyze the performance, the geographical site (Savar, Dhaka) was selected which has a latitude of 23.8538° and a longitude of 90.2534°. In this study, the most effective polycrystalline and monocrystalline solar cell has been founded which is 440 and 370 wp, respectively. Regarding this, a grid-connected PV system (12.3 Kwp) has been simulated which showed the performance ratio of the monocrystalline cell was 83.55%, which was better than the polycrystalline-based solar cell which was 79.6%. In terms of different kinds of orientations, monocrystalline at dual-axis tracking planes showed the highest value of energy injection to the grid was 25.8 MWh/year, while the least value has been founded in the fixed orientation plane which was 20.6 MWh/year. In this perspective, polycrystalline showed 23.9 and 19.5 MWh/year for dual-axis tracking and fixed orientation planes, respectively. Monocrystalline showed more energy injected into the grid compared to polycrystalline technologies for every orientation in the plant as well as the highest value of performance ratio."
Geometrical Optimization of 2D MoS2-Ag Rectangular and Triangular Grating for Enhanced Solar Cell Efficiency,"Harnessing the full potential of solar energy technology requires innovative approaches to optimize light absorption in solar cells. This study introduces a novel investigation into the use of MoS2-Ag rectangular and triangular grating structures to achieve this goal. Performing finite element analysis with the COMSOL 5.3a RF module provides the possibility to explore the impact of various silver (Ag) grating configurations on the absorption of light in photovoltaic (PV) cells. In order to find the best combination of MoS2 thickness, slit width, and metallic grating while keeping the periodicity of the grating device unchanged, an optimum value is calculated. The zeroth-order transmission spectra and near-field plots of the Fano-resonance (dip) associated with the excitation of the SPPs are carefully analyzed. Our findings reveal that specific configuration of rectangular grating, MoS2 thickness of 50 nm, and a slit width approximately half or just over half of the periodicity significantly enhances the light absorption. This research not only demonstrates the critical role of grating geometry in improving solar cell efficiency but also lays the groundwork for future advancements in solar energy technologies. By employing both far and near field analyses and rigorous statistical validation, our study offers a robust model for the geometrical optimization of grating structures, presenting a clear, impactful insight into the potential of these technologies for solar energy enhancement."
Can Conservatives Be Persuaded? Framing Effects on Support for Universal Basic Income in the US,"Universal basic income (UBI) has been proposed as a policy response to technological advances and structural inequality. Yet, recent data show that most conservatives in Europe and the US are strongly opposed to the welfare proposal. Can framing UBI as a policy that conforms to their ideological predispositions overcome such opposition? Exploiting the compatibility of UBI with core conservative ideals such as individualism and laissez-faire government, I design an original survey experiment that randomly exposes respondents to one of two frames: (1) an equalizing-opportunity frame which emphasizes that UBI creates a level playing field and promotes self-responsibility, or (2) a limiting-government frame which highlights UBI as a policy that limits government and reduces bureaucracy. I find that American conservatives—identified by using 10 policy statements—remained strongly opposed to UBI even after they were presented with such frames. Analyses of open-ended responses, which show that how conservatives explained their opposition to UBI remained unchanged regardless of framing, reinforce this conclusion. Conservatives’ opposition to UBI remained rigid, even after the key components of UBI that fit the conservative ideology were accentuated. These results shed light on the political feasibility of framing UBI, and the rigidity of welfare attitudes among American conservatives."
Are ‘red wall’ constituencies really opposed to progressive policy? Examining the impact of materialist narratives for Universal Basic Income,"Universal Basic Income (UBI) is often presented as desirable in theory, but unsaleable electorally. Policymakers fear intuitive, ‘values’-based opposition from socially conservative voters, whom the policy would benefit materially, but who might regard it as ‘giving others something for nothing’. We provide evidence from ‘red wall’ constituencies in Wales and the Midlands and North of England that indicates this presumption of voters is wrong. In Study 1, we find high levels of support for the policy, with different narrative framings more effective for different groups based on their material interests. In Study 2, we used a novel ‘adversarial collaboration’ method to show that simple narratives can strongly increase support for UBI even among respondents who initially see themselves as fundamentally opposed. The generated narratives stressed positive, material consequences of introducing UBI, rather than conformity with abstract values. This indicates that policymakers should exercise caution over ‘values’-based explanations for preferences."
"Robots, labor markets, and universal basic income","Automation is a big concern in modern societies in view of its widespread impact on many socioeconomic issues including income, jobs, and productivity. While previous studies have concentrated on determining the effects on jobs and salaries, our aim is to understand how automation affects productivity, and how some policies, such as taxes on robots or universal basic income, moderate or aggravate those effects. To this end, we have designed an experiment where workers make productive effort decisions, and managers can choose between workers and robots to do these tasks. In our baseline treatment, we measure the effort made by workers who may be replaced by robots, and also elicit firm replacement decisions. Subsequently, we carry out treatments in which workers have a universal basic income of about a fifth of the workers’ median wages, or where there is a tax levy on firms who replace workers by robots. We complete the picture of the impact of automation by looking into the coexistence of workers and robots with part-time jobs. We find that the threat of a robot substitution does not affect the amount of effort exerted by workers. Also, neither universal basic income nor a tax on robots decrease workers’ effort. We observe that the robot substitution tax reduces the probability of worker substitution. Finally, workers that benefit from managerial decisions to not substitute them by more productive robots do not increase their effort level. Our conclusions shed light on the interplay of policy and workers behavior under pervasive automation."
A global conservation basic income to safeguard biodiversity,"Biodiversity conservation supporting a global sustainability transformation must be inclusive, equitable, just and embrace plural values. The conservation basic income (CBI), a proposed unconditional cash transfer to individuals residing in important conservation areas, is a potentially powerful mechanism for facilitating this radical shift in conservation. This analysis provides comprehensive projections for potential gross costs of global CBI using spatial analyses of three plausible future conservation scenarios. Gross costs vary widely, depending on the areas and populations included, from US$351 billion to US$6.73 trillion annually. A US$5.50 per day CBI in existing protected areas in low- and middle-income countries would cost US$478 billion annually. These costs are large compared with current government conservation spending (~US$133 billion in 2020) but represent a potentially sensible investment in safeguarding incalculable social and natural values and the estimated US$44 trillion in global economic production dependent on nature."
Utilization of spent nuclear fuel and transuranic actinides in a two-component nuclear power industry,"According to the strategy for the development of the nuclear power industry in Russia for the first half of the 21st century, the nuclear power industry complex should undergo the initial stage in the formation of a two-component nuclear power system and a closed nuclear fuel cycle (NFC) infrastructure. All elements of such a nuclear power system, including NPPs, facilities for the fabrication of uranium and uranium-plutonium fuel, processing of spent nuclear fuel, and radioactive waste management, must be organically linked for producing competitive electricity in both domestic and foreign markets. The present article demonstrates the systemic benefits from a large-scale introduction of fast reactors for the Russian nuclear power industry in terms of a sustainable resource provision and a solution to the key problems of the final NFC stage, which is associated with the accumulation of spent fuel and transuranic actinides. The study proposes an optimum NFC closure scenario, in which the described problems can be solved without increasing the high parameters of the BR in a fast reactor and using special burners."
Ion-Plasma Technology for Nuclear Power Plants Deactivation,"AbstractTo solve the actual problem of nuclear power engineering the irradiated reactor graphite and metal structures of nuclear power plants deactivation, we have developed a new ion-plasma technology. For the first time we experimentally shown the ion-plasma technology efficiency on metal and reactor graphite samples under operating parameters."
Small Power Nuclear Plants: Technical Level and Prospects for Commercialization (Review),"AbstractThe active development of the Arctic and the Northern Sea Route determines the importance of the rapid development of energy-supply systems for remote regions. A key component of isolated power systems are low-power energy sources. The high cost of fossil fuels in remote regions, coupled with tightening environmental regulations, brings to the fore the challenge of implementing carbon-neutral energy generation technologies. Promising power plants, the performance of which is little dependent on weather conditions, and whose operation is not associated with the generation of greenhouse gas emissions, are low-power nuclear power plants. Currently, some countries are developing and implementing new types of reactor plants whose electrical power does not exceed 300 MW: according to the IAEA, there are more than 70 different projects. Modularity, versatility (in addition to power generation, many projects also provide for the production of thermal energy and hydrogen), increased compactness, and lower capital costs for construction compared to traditional high-power power units make it promising to create low-power reactor plants. This review presents an analysis of the current state of the problems in the design and implementation of such power plants. The technical level of domestic and foreign projects of small modular reactors (SMR) was assessed. Promising areas for the use of thermal energy from small modular installations have been identified, taking into account current trends in energy, including low-carbon and nuclear-hydrogen areas. Possible circuit solutions for the production of electricity based on advanced cycles, including the use of nontraditional working fluids, have been studied. The potential for commercialization of low-power nuclear power plant projects has been considered; the question of successful business implementation of power plants of this type remains open."
Alien Fish Species in Cooling Ponds of Nuclear Power Plants and State District Power Stations of Central Russia,"AbstractThe article presents an overview of alien fish species living in cooling ponds of nuclear power plants and state district power stations in Central Russia. A brief description of recipient reservoirs is given as a habitat for thermophilic fish species that are not characteristic of the native ichthyofauna of the region. The essays on the history of the appearance of these species, the peculiarities of biology, occurrence in catches, and fishery significance in six small reservoirs of special water management located within the borders of the Moscow, Smolensk, Ryazan, and Kursk oblasts of Russia are given. The main vectors of invasions of hydrobionts in cooling ponds for each alien species recorded as a result of ichthyological monitoring in this group of reservoirs are shown. The forecast of the dynamics of the number of alien fish species is given depending on changes in the thermal regime of reservoirs and the volume of stocking and the intensity of fishing in the cooling ponds of nuclear power plants and state district power plants of Central Russia."
Erosion and Corrosion of Pipelines and Equipment on the Power Uprate of Power Units at Nuclear Power Plants (NPP),"AbstractThe development of the modern nuclear industry is characterized by the conversion of operating power units to operation at a thermal power level above the current rated power level to enhance generation of electricity and reduce its cost. This process is referred to as a power uprate (PU). This can be done by increasing the thermal power of a reactor units and improving the efficiency of the turbine unit. In Russia and abroad, the thermal power of NPP power units is usually increased by 2–20% above the nominal level. Such measures are most widely implemented in the United States and Europe. Increasing the thermal power of a power unit above the rated value may require retrofitting of turbines, condensers, electric generators, and other equipment. The power uprate changes the operating conditions of equipment and pipelines of the power units, including such working fluid conditions as temperature, pressure, and steam wetness. This, in turn, can affect the erosion-corrosion rate of the metal of the working surfaces in the process circuit and decrease the residual service life until the maximum allowable thinning of the walls of equipment and pipelines is attained. Computational studies of foreign specialists demonstrate that the erosion-corrosion rate of individual pipelines and groups of equipment after the power uprate can increase by more than 50%. Because of this, obtaining a license for the power uprate of an NPP power unit in the United States requires computational studies using software tools to identify pipelines and equipment where the erosion-corrosion rate can increase. Since 2009, the RAMEK software code has been used at Russian nuclear power plants to predict the erosion-corrosion rate of pipeline and equipment elements. It is noted that, in practice, the power uprate of a power unit can enhance not only the erosion-corrosion rate in elements with a complex geometry in the flow path but also the effect of cavitation and droplet impact erosion. The expediency is pointed out of computational and experimental studies to assess the effect of changes in the operating conditions on the rate and distribution of erosion-corrosion wear of pipeline elements and equipment."
The Concept of a Nuclear Power Unit on the Basis of a Low-Power Multipurpose Test Research Reactor with Supercritical Light-Water Coolant,"AbstractHerein is presented a preliminary concept of a nuclear power installation (NPI) based on a low-power multipurpose test research reactor with a supercritical pressure light water coolant (LMTRR-SCP), which can operate as a test or research reactor, and has the following capabilities: substantiation of operating conditions for a supercritical water-cooled power reactor in the fast neutron spectrum; adjustment of the design operating regimes of the reactor with supercritical coolant conditions (including reactor startup, attainment of the energy power level, switch-over between power levels, rated power operation, shutdown, etc.); reactor irradiation of promising types of nuclear fuel, absorbing and structural materials for nuclear installations with fast, intermediate, or thermal neutron spectrum; comprehensive experimental and numerical investigations to obtain information required for development and verification of numerical codes; evaluation of new types of equipment for various process systems (including elements of emergency cooling systems, steam generators, etc.), instruments, and control, monitoring, and diagnostics systems for power reactors of various types. Investigations into the closed nuclear fuel cycle (CNFC) problem; utilization of actinides and handling of long-lived fission products, including pilot demonstration closure of the fuel cycle; mastering of processes for the manufacture of radionuclide products for various applications; production of modified materials; and use of the reactor’s thermal energy for heat and power generation. A potential also exists for the development of international cooperation within the scope of joint research programs on the basis of LMTRR-SCP."
Anomaly detection for early ransomware and spyware warning in nuclear power plant systems based on FusionGuard,"Securing critical infrastructure, particularly nuclear power plants, against emerging cyber threats necessitates innovative cybersecurity approaches. This research introduces FusionGuard, a hybrid machine learning-based anomaly detection system designed for early warnings of ransomware and spyware intrusions within nuclear power plant systems. Meticulously tailored to the unique characteristics of nuclear power plant networks, FusionGuard leverages diverse datasets encompassing normal operational behavior and historical threat data. Through cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, the system dynamically adapts to the network's baseline behavior, effectively identifying deviations indicative of ransomware or spyware activities. Rigorous experimentation and validation using real-world data and simulated attack scenarios affirm FusionGuard's proficiency in detecting anomalous behavior with remarkable accuracy and minimal false positives. The research also explores the system's scalability and adaptability to evolving attack vectors, fortifying the cybersecurity posture of nuclear power plant systems in a dynamic threat landscape. In summary, FusionGuard promises to fortify the security of nuclear power plant systems against ransomware and spyware threats by capitalizing on machine learning and anomaly detection. Serving as a sentinel, the system issues timely alerts and enables proactive responses, contributing substantively to the ongoing discourse on protecting essential systems in high-stakes environments."
Intelligent planning of controllers for improved resilience in multi-area system involving nuclear power,"Increased innovation on finding new ways to generate energy from different sources to meet the growing demand of consumers has led to various challenges in controlling the power network when it faces different disruptions. To address these challenges, a new approach has been proposed in this research paper, which combines a controller with a soft computing technique called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The study considers a power system with four units, where three different energy sources are utilized and distributed across two areas. Each area has two power sources, with one area having a combination of thermal and gas power plants, and the other area consisting of a nuclear power plant and a gas power plant. Transmitting power from the nuclear power plant is particularly complex due to its high sensitivity to disturbances. Therefore, an intelligent and efficient controller is needed to ensure robust control in this type of power network that includes nuclear power. The paper also conducts a thorough analysis of the harmful emissions associated with electricity generation from the different power plants considered. The goal is to reduce the carbon footprint associated with power generation. The proposed work and analysis in the paper are implemented using the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment."
Fire simulation in the main control room of Bushehr nuclear power plant using CFAST software,"Fire protection is one of the most important issues to ensure safety and reduce risks of nuclear power plants. The main control room (MCR) is one of the parts of a nuclear power plant that is often identified with a high risk of fire in safety assessments. Although robust programs to shut down commercial reactors in any fires have been successfully maintained, the purpose of this paper is to simulate the fire in the MCR of Bushehr nuclear power plant unit‑1 (BNPP-1) using CFAST software. CFAST is a two-zone fire model used to calculate the evolving distribution of smoke, fire gases, and temperature throughout the compartments of a building during a fire. The data required for simulation have been extracted from final safety analysis reports and operating documents of BNPP‑1 and NUREG6850 reports. The results showed that the highest recorded temperature was related to the upper part of the standing cabinet about 1013 °C, which is the result of flames as well as heat transfer through smoke. Also, the other highest recorded temperature was in the lower part of the standing cabinet about 700 °C. Finally, the first ventilation system was closed for about 350 s and the second ventilation system was closed for about 860 s after the fire started."
On the Road to Justice: Some Selected Suggestions for the Future of Social Justice Research,"In this paper, several aspects of social justice research are reviewed to analyze the current state of the field and to suggest refinements and new directions. The micro–macro-levels problem is discussed, including the policy of affirmative action. A canon of relevant philosophers is proposed. The strong influence of justice principles on social change research, search conferences and group interventions are demonstrated. The information value of social justice theories can be strengthened in several ways. Expanded information value implies increased effectiveness of advice and interventions. Possibilities to integrate justice criteria in total quality management are discussed. Contemporary quality management focuses on triple-P criteria: people, planet, profit, highly relevant for basic and applied justice research. The current state of the social justice discipline is rather good, but there is room for improvement. Finally, interdisciplinary research is the future, in particular for studies to solve complex societal and global problems."
The Organizational Underpinnings of Social Justice Theory Development,"Existing psychological theories about justice developed during a classic period when social justice was a core aspect of social psychology. These theories have gone on to have impact on a number of fields concerned with addressing social, political and economic issues. At the same time shifts in the field of psychology have increasingly marginalized social justice scholars, diminishing new theoretical developments. This paper identifies organizational changes that would encourage a new generation of social justice theory researchers, something made important by the increasing number and severity of the justice relevant problems arising in the world."
Basic social justice orientations—measuring order-related justice in the European Social Survey Round 9,"Individuals hold normative ideas about the just distribution of goods and burdens within a social aggregate. These normative ideas guide the evaluation of existing inequalities and refer to four basic principles: (1) Equality stands for an equal distribution of rewards and burdens. While the principle of (2) need takes individual contributions into account, (3) equity suggests a distribution based on merit. The (4) entitlement principle suggests that ascribed (e.g., gender) and achieved status characteristics (e.g., occupational prestige) should determine the distribution of goods and burdens. Past research has argued that preferences for these principles vary with social position as well as the social structure of a society. The Basic Social Justice Orientations (BSJO) scale was developed to assess agreement with the four justice principles but so far has only been fielded in Germany. Round 9 of the European Social Survey (ESS R9 with data collected in 2018/2019) is the first time; four items of the BSJO scale (1 item per justice principle) were included in a cross-national survey program, offering the unique opportunity to study both within and between country variation. To facilitate substantive research on preference for equality, equity, need, and entitlement, this report provides evidence on measurement quality in 29 European countries from ESS R9. Analyzing response distributions, non-response, reliability, and associations with related variables, we find supportive evidence that the four items of the BSJO scale included in ESS R9 produce low non-response rates, estimate agreement with the four distributive principles reliably, and follow expected correlations with related concepts. Researchers should, however, remember that the BSJO scale, as implemented in the ESS R9, only provides manifest indicators, which therefore may not cover the full spectrum of the underlying distributive principles but focus on specific elements of it."
A systematic review and meta-analysis of procedural justice and legitimacy in policing: the effect of social identity and social contexts,"ObjectivesTo systematically review the effect of social identity and social contexts on the association between procedural justice and legitimacy in policing.MethodsA meta-analysis synthesising data from 123 studies (N = 200,966) addressing the relationship between procedural justice and legitimacy in policing. Random effects univariate and two-stage structural equation modelling meta-analyses were performed.ResultsBoth procedural justice and social identity are found to be significantly correlated with police legitimacy. Moreover, social identity significantly mediates, but does not moderate, the association between procedural justice and legitimacy. People of younger age and from more developed countries tend to correlate procedural justice stronger with police legitimacy.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that social identity is an important antecedent of legitimacy and a critical factor in the dynamics of procedural fairness in policing. It also shows that the extent to which procedural justice and legitimacy are correlated varies across social groups and contexts. The theoretical implications of our findings are discussed."
Teachers’ Social Emotional Learning Competencies and Social Justice Teaching Beliefs and Associations with Children’s Prosocial Behavior and Community Engagement,"BackgroundIndividual and collective prosocial competence can be fostered through high-quality interactions with program staff in out-of-school time environments.ObjectiveWe explored whether the social-emotional competencies of teachers working in an out-of-school STEM program infused with social emotional learning content were associated with school children’s prosocial behavior, community engagement, and peer problems and whether these associations were moderated by social justice teaching beliefs and child gender.MethodParticipants were 126 students (72 male). Forty-one were White, 40 were Black, 34 were Latine, and 11 were Asian and most of them were third graders (Mage = 8.11 years). Teachers rated their emotional competence, commitment to social emotional learning, and social justice teaching beliefs. They also provided ratings of children’s prosocial behavior and peer problems. Students provided ratings of their community engagement.ResultsTeachers’ emotional competence was negatively associated with prosocial behavior, but only when their social justice teaching beliefs were low. However, teachers’ commitment to social emotional learning was positively related to prosocial behavior. Teachers’ emotional competence was associated positively with peer problems, but only for girls, and was also related positively to community engagement.ConclusionsResults demonstrate associations between STEM teachers’ social emotional learning competencies and social justice teaching beliefs in the development of students’ prosocial competence and community engagement and provide directions for future research."
Learning to Lead for Equity and Social Justice through Critical Reflection and Autobiography,"In this paper, the authors utilize critical reflection and autobiographical narratives as a pedagogical tool for aspiring school leaders to examine beliefs and assumptions on equity and social justice in an educational leadership preparation program. Comparative themes related to their developing social justice and equity orientations included: (a)Understanding heritage and lived experience in relation to inequity and injustice, (b) Positionality awareness as a meaning making tool for leadership development, and (c) Praxis: Aspiration for action in one’s leadership role. Incorporating pedagogical tools that engage in difficult conversations with the self and the world has the potential to provided avenues for students to become active interpreters of their past histories, current aspirations and heighten their capacity to be active agents of justice."
Focusing on the “Social” in Social Justice Research,"I describe what I see as a very strong connection between fairness perceptions and reactions that show engagement with social entities and social relationships. A brief review of studies on perceived fairness and the fair process effects illustrates how very social is the reaction to fair or unfair treatment—that is,  how perceptions of fairness have a strong impact on how people view their inclusion and safety in the social group or relationship in which the treatment occurs. I suggest that this much-observed connection between fairness and group engagement raises some interesting questions about how perceived fairness affects some traditional group process phenomena. I discuss research questions that arise with respect to fairness and social identity process, fairness and obedience to authority, and fairness and conformity. Investigations of these questions, I argue, would give the field a stronger foundation in the basic social psychology of fairness and it would re-invigorate the groups aspect of social psychology as a discipline."
AI ethics and ordoliberalism 2.0: towards a ‘Digital Bill of Rights’,"This article analyzes AI ethics from a distinct business ethics perspective, i.e., ‘ordoliberalism 2.0.’ It argues that the ongoing discourse on (generative) AI relies too much on corporate self-regulation and voluntary codes of conduct and thus lacks adequate governance mechanisms. To address these issues, the paper suggests not only introducing hard-law legislation with a more effective oversight structure but also merging already existing AI guidelines with an ordoliberal-inspired regulatory and competition policy. However, this link between AI ethics, regulation, and antitrust is not yet adequately discussed in the academic literature and beyond. The paper thus closes a significant gap in the academic literature and adds to the predominantly legal-political and philosophical discourse on AI governance. The paper’s research questions and goals are twofold: first, it identifies ordoliberal-inspired AI ethics principles that could serve as the foundation for a ‘digital bill of rights.’ Second, it shows how those principles could be implemented at the macro level with the help of ordoliberal competition and regulatory policy."
From AI Ethics Principles to Practices: A Teleological Methodology to Apply AI Ethics Principles in The Defence Domain,"This article provides a methodology for the interpretation of AI ethics principles to specify ethical criteria for the development and deployment of AI systems in high-risk domains. The methodology consists of a three-step process deployed by an independent, multi-stakeholder ethics board to: (1) identify the appropriate level of abstraction for modelling the AI lifecycle; (2) interpret prescribed principles to extract specific requirements to be met at each step of the AI lifecycle; and (3) define the criteria to inform purpose- and context-specific balancing of the principles. The methodology presented in this article is designed to be agile, adaptable, and replicable, and when used as part of a pro-ethical institutional culture, will help to foster the ethical design, development, and deployment of AI systems. The application of the methodology is illustrated through reference to the UK Ministry of Defence AI ethics principles."
Reflections on Putting AI Ethics into Practice: How Three AI Ethics Approaches Conceptualize Theory and Practice,"Critics currently argue that applied ethics approaches to artificial intelligence (AI) are too principles-oriented and entail a theory–practice gap. Several applied ethical approaches try to prevent such a gap by conceptually translating ethical theory into practice. In this article, we explore how the currently most prominent approaches of AI ethics translate ethics into practice. Therefore, we examine three approaches to applied AI ethics: the embedded ethics approach, the ethically aligned approach, and the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach. We analyze each of these three approaches by asking how they understand and conceptualize theory and practice. We outline the conceptual strengths as well as their shortcomings: an embedded ethics approach is context-oriented but risks being biased by it; ethically aligned approaches are principles-oriented but lack justification theories to deal with trade-offs between competing principles; and the interdisciplinary Value Sensitive Design approach is based on stakeholder values but needs linkage to political, legal, or social governance aspects. Against this background, we develop a meta-framework for applied AI ethics conceptions with three dimensions. Based on critical theory, we suggest these dimensions as starting points to critically reflect on the conceptualization of theory and practice. We claim, first, that the inclusion of the dimension of affects and emotions in the ethical decision-making process stimulates reflections on vulnerabilities, experiences of disregard, and marginalization already within the AI development process. Second, we derive from our analysis that considering the dimension of justifying normative background theories provides both standards and criteria as well as guidance for prioritizing or evaluating competing principles in cases of conflict. Third, we argue that reflecting the governance dimension in ethical decision-making is an important factor to reveal power structures as well as to realize ethical AI and its application because this dimension seeks to combine social, legal, technical, and political concerns. This meta-framework can thus serve as a reflective tool for understanding, mapping, and assessing the theory–practice conceptualizations within AI ethics approaches to address and overcome their blind spots."
A semi-automated software model to support AI ethics compliance assessment of an AI system guided by ethical principles of AI,"Compliance with principles and guidelines for ethical AI has a significant impact on companies engaged in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Specifically, ethics is a broad concept that continuously evolves over time and across cultural and geographical boundaries. International organisations (IOs), individual states, and private groups, all have an interest in defining the concept of ethics of AI. IOs, as well as regional and national bodies, have issued many decisions on AI ethics. Developing a system that complies with the ethical framework poses a complex challenge for companies, and the consequences of not complying with ethical principles can have severe consequences, making compliance with these requirements a key issue for companies. Furthermore, there is a shortage of technical tools to ensure that such AI systems comply with ethical criteria. The scarcity of ethics compliance checking tools for AI, and the current focus on defining ethical guidelines for AI development, has led us to undertake a proposal consisting in a semi-automated software model to verify the ethical compliance of an AI system’s code. To implement this model, we focus on the following important aspects: (1) a literature review to identify existing ethical compliance systems, (2) a review of principles and guidelines for ethical AI to determine the international and European views regarding AI ethics, and (3) the identification of commonly accepted principles and sub-principles of AI. These elements served to inform (4) our proposal for the design of a semi-automated software for verifying the ethical compliance of AI systems both at design-time (ethics-by-design perspective) and afterwards on the resulting software."
Towards AI ethics’ institutionalization: knowledge bridges from business ethics to advance organizational AI ethics,"This paper proposes to generate awareness for developing Artificial intelligence (AI) ethics by transferring knowledge from other fields of applied ethics, particularly from business ethics, stressing the role of organizations and processes of institutionalization. With the rapid development of AI systems in recent years, a new and thriving discourse on AI ethics has (re-)emerged, dealing primarily with ethical concepts, theories, and application contexts. We argue that business ethics insights may generate positive knowledge spillovers for AI ethics, given that debates on ethical and social responsibilities have been adopted as voluntary or mandatory regulations for organizations in both national and transnational contexts. Thus, business ethics may transfer knowledge from five core topics and concepts researched and institutionalized to AI ethics: (1) stakeholder management, (2) standardized reporting, (3) corporate governance and regulation, (4) curriculum accreditation, and as a unified topic (5) AI ethics washing derived from greenwashing. In outlining each of these five knowledge bridges, we illustrate current challenges in AI ethics and potential insights from business ethics that may advance the current debate. At the same time, we hold that business ethics can learn from AI ethics in catching up with the digital transformation, allowing for cross-fertilization between the two fields. Future debates in both disciplines of applied ethics may benefit from dialog and cross-fertilization, meant to strengthen the ethical depth and prevent ethics washing or, even worse, ethics bashing."
Unveiling public perception of AI ethics: an exploration on Wikipedia data,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have exposed more and more ethical issues while providing services to people. It is challenging for people to realize the occurrence of AI ethical issues in most cases. The lower the public awareness, the more difficult it is to address AI ethical issues. Many previous studies have explored public reactions and opinions on AI ethical issues through questionnaires and social media platforms like Twitter. However, these approaches primarily focus on categorizing popular topics and sentiments, overlooking the public’s potential lack of knowledge underlying these issues. Few studies revealed the holistic knowledge structure of AI ethical topics and the relations among the subtopics. As the world’s largest online encyclopedia, Wikipedia encourages people to jointly contribute and share their knowledge by adding new topics and following a well-accepted hierarchical structure. Through public viewing and editing, Wikipedia serves as a proxy for knowledge transmission. This study aims to analyze how the public comprehend the body of knowledge of AI ethics. We adopted the community detection approach to identify the hierarchical community of the AI ethical topics, and further extracted the AI ethics-related entities, which are proper nouns, organizations, and persons. The findings reveal that the primary topics at the top-level community, most pertinent to AI ethics, predominantly revolve around knowledge-based and ethical issues. Examples include transitions from Information Theory to Internet Copyright Infringement. In summary, this study contributes to three points, (1) to present the holistic knowledge structure of AI ethics, (2) to evaluate and improve the existing body of knowledge of AI ethics, (3) to enhance public perception of AI ethics to mitigate the risks associated with AI technologies."
How to design an AI ethics board,"The development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems poses significant risks to society. To reduce these risks to an acceptable level, AI companies need an effective risk management process and sound risk governance. In this paper, we explore a particular way in which AI companies can improve their risk governance: by setting up an AI ethics board. We identify five key design choices: (1) What responsibilities should the board have? (2) What should its legal structure be? (3) Who should sit on the board? (4) How should it make decisions? (5) And what resources does it need? We break each of these questions down into more specific sub-questions, list options, and discuss how different design choices affect the board’s ability to reduce societal risks from AI. Several failures have shown that designing an AI ethics board can be challenging. This paper provides a toolbox that can help AI companies to overcome these challenges."
Embedding responsibility in intelligent systems: from AI ethics to responsible AI ecosystems,"Intelligent systems that are capable of making autonomous decisions based on input from their environment have great potential to do good, but they also raise significant social and ethical concerns. The discourse on ethics and artificial intelligence (AI) has covered these concerns in depth and developed an array of possible ways of addressing them. This article argues that a shortcoming of this discourse is that it concentrates on specific issues and their mitigation but neglects the nature of intelligent systems as socio-technical systems of systems that are often described as ecosystems. Building on the discussion of ethics and AI, the article suggests that it would be beneficial to come to an understanding of what would constitute responsible AI ecosystems. By introducing the concept of meta-responsibility or higher-level responsibility, the article proposes characteristics that an ecosystem would have to fulfil, in order to be considered a responsible ecosystem. This perspective is theoretically interesting because it extends the current AI ethics discourse. It furthermore offers a novel perspective for researchers and developers of intelligent system and helps them reflect on the way they relate to ethical issues."
The ethics of AI business practices: a review of 47 AI ethics guidelines,"Many AI ethics guidelines have recently been published that center the fairness, accountability, sustainability, and transparency of algorithmic decision-making. Relatively few guidelines center the ethics of the business practices and political economies in which AI systems are situated. We present the findings of a semi-systematic literature review and thematic analysis aimed at determining the extent to which the ethics of AI business practices are considered in a large sample of guidelines. Our review reveals that the political and economic implications of AI business practices are greatly underrepresented in AI ethics guidelines. In its current state, AI ethics guidelines focus disproportionately on issues of algorithmic decision-making, while the fairness, accountability, sustainability, and transparency of the business decision-making contexts in which AI systems are situated remain seriously undermined by competitive and speculative norms, ethics washing, corporate secrecy, and other harmful business practices. We discuss these challenges, and we suggest that the ontological and disciplinary scope of future AI ethics guidelines should be expanded to better contend with them."
Ethics in AI through the practitioner’s view: a grounded theory literature review,"The term ethics is widely used, explored, and debated in the context of developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) based software systems. In recent years, numerous incidents have raised the profile of ethical issues in AI development and led to public concerns about the proliferation of AI technology in our everyday lives. But what do we know about the views and experiences of those who develop these systems – the AI practitioners? We conducted a grounded theory literature review (GTLR) of 38 primary empirical studies that included AI practitioners’ views on ethics in AI and analysed them to derive five categories: practitioner awareness, perception, need, challenge, and approach. These are underpinned by multiple codes and concepts that we explain with evidence from the included studies. We present a taxonomy of ethics in AI from practitioners’ viewpoints to assist AI practitioners in identifying and understanding the different aspects of AI ethics. The taxonomy provides a landscape view of the key aspects that concern AI practitioners when it comes to ethics in AI. We also share an agenda for future research studies and recommendations for practitioners, managers, and organisations to help in their efforts to better consider and implement ethics in AI."
AI ethics: from principles to practice,"Much of the current work on AI ethics has lost its connection to the real-world impact by making AI ethics operable. There exist significant limitations of hyper-focusing on the identification of abstract ethical principles, lacking effective collaboration among stakeholders, and lacking the communication of ethical principles to real-world applications. This position paper presents challenges in making AI ethics operable and highlights key obstacles to AI ethics impact. A preliminary practice example is provided to initiate practical implementations of AI ethics. We aim to inspire discussions on making AI ethics operable and focus on its impact on real-world applications."
Mitochondrial gene editing,"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are responsible for several severe diseases that have no available cures. The multicopy nature of the mitochondrial genome means that mutations often exist in a state known as heteroplasmy, where both mutant and wild-type mtDNA are present in the same cell. The wild-type mtDNA can functionally compensate for the mutant mtDNA until a mutation threshold is reached, beyond which disease symptoms begin to manifest. Despite the interest mitochondrial genetics has generated, the double mitochondrial membrane proved to be a formidable barrier to genetic manipulation. However, in the past two decades, scientists have discovered that mtDNA could be modified by importing gene editing proteins to target specific DNA sequences. Mitochondria-targeted nucleases specifically cleave and eliminate mutant mtDNA in heteroplasmic cells and in animal models. More recently, base editors have been adapted to modify mtDNA via precise C>T or A>G transitions. Therefore, tools to modify mtDNA are, finally, a reality with the promise to revolutionize the mitochondrial genetics field. This Primer delves into mitochondrial gene editing, providing details on the selection of mitochondrial gene editing tools, best practices for designing experiments, relevant types of analyses and specific applications and limitations pertaining to the different technologies and the field."
Gene Editing for the Treatment of Hypercholesterolemia,"Purpose of ReviewHere, we summarize the key findings from preclinical studies that tested the concept that editing of hepatic genes can lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels to subsequently reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.Recent FindingsSelective delivery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated gene editing tools targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) to hepatocytes, i.e., through encapsulation into N-acetylgalactosamine-coupled lipid nanoparticles, is able to induce a stable ~ 90% decrease in plasma PCSK9 levels and a concomitant 60% reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels in mice and non-humane primates. Studies in mice have shown that this state-of-the-art technology can be extended to include additional targets related to dyslipidemia such as angiopoietin-like 3 and several apolipoproteins.SummaryThe use of gene editors holds great promise to lower plasma LDL-cholesterol levels also in the human setting. However, gene editing safety has to be guaranteed before this approach can become a clinical success."
Multiplexed gene editing in citrus by using a multi-intron containing Cas9 gene,"Several expression systems have been developed in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) framework allowing for gene editing of disease-associated genes across diverse citrus varieties. In this study, we present a new approach employing a multi-intron containing Cas9 gene plus multiple gRNAs separated with tRNA sequences to target the phytoene desaturase gene in both ‘Carrizo’ citrange and ‘Duncan’ grapefruit. Notably, using this unified vector significantly boosted editing efficiency in both citrus varieties, showcasing mutations in all three designated targets. The implementation of this multiplex gene editing system with a multi-intron-containing Cas9 plus a gRNA-tRNA array demonstrates a promising avenue for efficient citrus genome editing, equipping us with potent tools in the ongoing battle against several diseases such as canker and huanglongbing."
Gene editing and therapy in acquired and inherited cardiovascular disorders,"Gene editing and therapy holds immense promise in addressing cardiovascular disorders by enabling precise modifications to the genetic groundworks of these conditions. This technology offers a targeted approach to correct or mitigate not only the genetic mutations that are responsible for inherited cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), but also in controlling and regulating the genes in conditions that are age-related or that arise due to unnecessary gene activity, which often lack effective treatments. By editing the relevant genes, we aim to reduce disease severity, improve heart function, prevent future episodes and potentially improve the health span. Recent trials involving gene therapy and gene editing in cardiovascular disorders have revolutionized treatment strategies, offering hope for patients with genetic predispositions to heart and vessel-related ailments and advancing the pursuit for more personalized and effective therapies. In this review, we have consolidated the genetic mutations causing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) followed by latest advancements in the gene editing technologies and their therapeutic implications along with involved ethical challenges and risk factors.Graphical Abstract"
Simulation of dual-purpose chicken breeding programs implementing gene editing,"BackgroundIn spite of being controversial and raising ethical concerns, the application of gene editing is more likely to be accepted when it contributes to improving animal welfare. One of the animal welfare and ethical issues in chicken breeding is chick culling, the killing of the male layer chicks after hatching due to the poor fattening performance. Although establishing dual-purpose chicken lines could solve this problem, unfavorable genetic correlations between egg and meat production traits hindered their competitiveness. Although it is also controversial in ethical terms, gene editing may accelerate genetic progress in dual-purpose chicken and alleviate the ethical concerns from chick culling.ResultsThe simulation compared the utility improvement in dual-purpose use under two breeding schemes: one consisting in the improvement of the laying hens, and the second in the improvement of a synthetic line obtained from a layer broiler cross. In each breeding scheme, the breeding programs were simulated with and without gene editing. Polygenic breeding values and 500 simulated quantitative trait loci (QTL) with different levels of pleiotropy caused negative correlations between egg production, meat production, and overall health. The results of the simulation demonstrated that genetic gain could be accelerated by at most 81% for several generations if gene editing was used. The actual increase in genetic gain depended on the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being edited per animal. The rate of genetic improvement became equal in scenarios with and without gene editing after 20 generations. This is because the remaining segregating QTL had small effects and their edition would have negative overall health effects from potential off-target edits. Although gene editing can improve genetic gain in quantitative traits, it can only be recommended as long as QTL with reasonable effect sizes are segregating and detectable.ConclusionsThis simulation demonstrates the potential of gene editing to accelerate the simultaneous improvement of negatively correlated traits. When the risk of negative consequences from gene editing persists, the number of SNPs to be edited should be chosen carefully to obtain the optimal genetic gain."
Gene editing tool kit in millets: present status and future directions,"Millets, the sixth most-grown group of crops in the drylands, support the livelihood of many small-holder farmers in the region. Being one of the most nutritious groups of crops, their production has been increasing since the last decade to meet the demands of the world’s ever-increasing population. Since its discovery, CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene editing technology has revolutionized trait improvement in numerous crops by enabling targeted insertions and deletions at specific gene sequences. With advancements like base editing and prime editing, which offer precise modifications at the nucleotide level, this technology holds great promise for enhancing millets by targeting genes responsible for key traits. The updated sequence information in the public domain makes it possible to modify certain genic regions using the CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene editing technology to develop millet crops with improved agronomical properties. The review explores each component of the editing toolbox in millets, including the gRNA designing tools, types of Cas nucleases, and promoters to be considered for enhanced and efficient gene editing in millets. We have discussed fundamental information available to successfully employ CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene editing in millets, such as the availability of genomic information and plant transformation methods. Finally, we have highlighted the limitations of employing this novel technology in millet crops by providing future directions and immediate candidate genes that could be targeted to improve various traits in millet crops.Graphical abstract"
TALE-based organellar genome editing and gene expression in plants,"Key messageTALE-based editors provide an alternative way to engineer the organellar genomes in plants. We update and discuss the most recent developments of TALE-based organellar genome editing in plants.AbstractGene editing tools have been widely used to modify the nuclear genomes of plants for various basic research and biotechnological applications. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 editing platform is the most commonly used technique because of its ease of use, fast speed, and low cost; however, it encounters difficulty when being delivered to plant organelles for gene editing. In contrast, protein-based editing technologies, such as transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-based tools, could be easily delivered, expressed, and targeted to organelles in plants via Agrobacteria-mediated nuclear transformation. Therefore, TALE-based editors provide an alternative way to engineer the organellar genomes in plants since the conventional chloroplast transformation method encounters technical challenges and is limited to certain species, and the direct transformation of mitochondria in higher plants is not yet possible. In this review, we update and discuss the most recent developments of TALE-based organellar genome editing in plants."
Finely tuned ionizable lipid nanoparticles for CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein delivery and gene editing,"Nonviral delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system provides great benefits for in vivo gene therapy due to the low risk of side effects. However, in vivo gene editing by delivering the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is challenging due to the poor delivery into target tissues and cells. Here, we introduce an effective delivery method for the CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs by finely tuning the formulation of ionizable lipid nanoparticles. The LNPs delivering CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs (CrLNPs) are demonstrated to induce gene editing with high efficiencies in various cancer cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, we show that CrLNPs can be delivered into tumor tissues with high efficiency, as well as induce significant gene editing in vivo. The current study presents an effective platform for nonviral delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system that can be applied as an in vivo gene editing therapeutic for treating various diseases such as cancer and genetic disorders."
Application of genome editing techniques to regulate gene expression in crops,"BackgroundEnhanced agricultural production is urgently required to meet the food demands of the increasing global population. Abundant genetic diversity is expected to accelerate crop development. In particular, the development of the CRISPR/Cas genome editing technology has greatly enhanced our ability to improve crop’s genetic diversity through direct artificial gene modification. However, recent studies have shown that most crop improvement efforts using CRISPR/Cas techniques have mainly focused on the coding regions, and there is a relatively lack of studies on the regulatory regions of gene expression.ResultsThis review briefly summarizes the development of CRISPR/Cas system in the beginning. Subsequently, the importance of gene regulatory regions in plants is discussed. The review focuses on recent developments and applications of mutations in regulatory regions via CRISPR/Cas techniques in crop breeding.ConclusionFinally, an outline of perspectives for future crop breeding using genome editing technologies is provided. This review provides new research insights for crop improvement using genome editing techniques."
Advances in miniature CRISPR-Cas proteins and their applications in gene editing,"The CRISPR-Cas system consists of Cas proteins and single-stranded RNAs that recruit Cas proteins and specifically target the nucleic acid. Some Cas proteins can accurately cleave the target nucleic acid under the guidance of the single-stranded RNAs. Due to its exceptionally high specificity, the CRISPR-Cas system is now widely used in various fields such as gene editing, transcription regulation, and molecular diagnosis. However, the huge size of the most frequently utilized Cas proteins (Cas9, Cas12a, and Cas13, which contain 950-1,400 amino acids) can limit their applicability, especially in eukaryotic gene editing, where larger Cas proteins are difficult to deliver into the target cells. Recently discovered miniature CRISPR-Cas proteins, consisting of only 400 to 800 amino acids, offer the possibility of overcoming this limitation. This article systematically reviews the latest research progress of several miniature CRISPR-Cas proteins (Cas12f, Cas12j, Cas12k, and Cas12m) and their practical applications in the field of gene editing."
Enabling regulatory policy globally will promote realization of the potential of animal biotechnology,"Animal biotechnologies have the potential to improve the sustainability and security of our global food systems. Government regulatory authorities are responsible for ensuring the safety of food their citizens consume, whether it is produced via conventional breeding methods or biotechnologies. While some countries have implemented animal biotechnology oversight policies, many countries have yet to develop theirs. Historically, regulatory approvals were required before products of biotechnology could enter the marketplace, and the high cost of the approval process limited the number and types of animal and plant products that sought approval. Only one biotech animal in the world that was developed for food production has reached the market under a GMO or rDNA approval process. The advent of genome editing techniques has revolutionized the scientific approach to introducing changes into DNA sequences and how biotechnology can be used to enhance agricultural breeding. Regulatory dialogs about biotechnology also have changed as a result of these new technologies. Regulatory agencies have begun to respond to these scientific advances, and a growing number of countries are looking to modernize regulatory approaches for these products, based on risk (or lack thereof) and similarity to organisms that could be produced via conventional breeding methods. Advances in animal biotechnology, especially genome editing, can accelerate the incorporation of valued phenotypes in animals, including enhanced yield, disease resistance, resilience to changing climate, and improved animal welfare, as well as food qualities valued by consumers. For animals with these biotechnology-introduced traits to enter agricultural production and reach consumers, clear risk-proportionate regulatory approaches must be in place, and to facilitate international trade of animal products, regulatory processes need to be aligned and compatible. Effective scientific public communication is crucial to build public trust in precision animal biotechnology and risk-proportionate regulatory approaches. An international workshop on regulatory approaches for animal biotechnology was convened in 2022 with 27 countries represented. We synthesize here technical progress, development of regulatory policy, and strategies for engagement with diverse publics on animal biotechnology reported in the workshop. Our goal is to encourage development and implementation of risk-proportionate regulatory approaches and policies in a global context."
Can I benefit from laboratory automation? A decision aid for the successful introduction of laboratory automation,"The large volumes of samples to be analysed every day would be impossible to manage without laboratory automation. As laboratory procedures have progressed, so have the tasks of laboratory personnel. With this feature article, we would like to provide (bio)chemical practitioners with little or no knowledge of laboratory automation with a guide to help them decide whether to implement laboratory automation and find a suitable system. Especially in small- and medium-sized laboratories, operating a laboratory system means having bioanalytical knowledge, but also being familiar with the technical aspects. However, time, budget and personnel limitations allow little opportunity for personnel to get into the depths of laboratory automation. This includes not only the operation, but also the decision to purchase an automation system. Hasty investments do not only result in slow or non-existent cost recovery, but also occupy valuable laboratory space. We have structured the article as a decision tree, so readers can selectively read chapters that apply to their individual situation. This flexible approach allows each reader to create a personal reading flow tailored to their specific needs. We tried to address a variety of perspectives on the topic, including people who are either supportive or sceptical of laboratory automation, personnel who want or need to automate specific processes, those who are unsure whether to automate and those who are interested in automation but do not know which areas to prioritize. We also help to make a decision whether to reactivate or discard already existing and unused laboratory equipment."
Government size and automation,"This paper explores the consequences of automation for public finance. We find that as the automation rate increases, the government size, measured as the fiscal revenues to output ratio, declines. This is due to the substitution of traditional inputs, which bear the burden of taxes, by the new automatic technology. These results are explained by the effects of automation on labor, where taxation of labor income (including social security contributions) represents the most important source of fiscal revenues in most advanced economies. The paper conducts two additional counterfactual experiments. First, we calculate how individual tax rates should be changed in response to automation in order to maintain constant fiscal revenues from the different sources of taxes. This experiment reveals that this fiscal policy would have significantly detrimental effects on output and labor, and indicates that a comprehensive reform of the current tax mix is necessary to counterbalance the effects of automation on public finance. Second, we calculate the tax rate on capital, without modifying the other tax rates, required to keep constant the size of the government, resulting in a capital income tax rate of around 0.77 for an automation rate of \(45 \%\)."
A conceptual framework for automation disengagements,"A better understanding of automation disengagements can lead to improved safety and efficiency of automated systems. This study investigates the factors contributing to automation disengagements initiated by human operators and the automation itself by analyzing semi-structured interviews with 103 users of Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD Beta. The factors leading to automation disengagements are represented by categories. In total, we identified five main categories, and thirty-five subcategories. The main categories include human operator states (5), human operator’s perception of the automation (17), human operator’s perception of other humans (3), the automation’s perception of the human operator (3), and the automation incapability in the environment (7). Human operators disengaged the automation when they anticipated failure, observed unnatural or unwanted automation behavior (e.g., erratic steering, running red lights), or believed the automation is not capable to operate safely in certain environments (e.g., inclement weather, non-standard roads). Negative experiences of human operators, such as frustration, unsafe feelings, and distrust represent some of the adverse human operate states leading to automation disengagements initiated by human operators. The automation, in turn, monitored human operators and disengaged itself if it detected insufficient vigilance or speed rule violations by human operators. Moreover, human operators can be influenced by the reactions of passengers and other road users, leading them to disengage the automation if they sensed discomfort, anger, or embarrassment due to the automation’s actions. The results of the analysis are synthesized into a conceptual framework for automation disengagements, borrowing ideas from the human factor's literature and control theory. This research offers insights into the factors contributing to automation disengagements, and highlights not only the concerns of human operators but also the social aspects of this phenomenon. The findings provide information on potential edge cases of automated vehicle technology, which may help to enhance the safety and efficiency of such systems."
Automation of Production Processes: Problems and Solutions,"AbstractAttention focuses on the automation of production processes at Russian enterprises within state programs for digitization, in an era of sanctions pressure. The current problems are analyzed. Software for the automation of production is investigated. A sequence of steps for the automation of production processes is proposed."
Does automation improve financial reporting? Evidence from internal controls,"Automation—such as machine learning, robotic process automation, and artificial intelligence—is the next major technological leap in accounting and financial reporting, and I empirically study whether public firms’ use of automation technology improves their financial reporting, specifically focusing on the internal control environment. I document two critical inferences. First, I find evidence which suggests that automation improves financial reporting quality. Specifically, firms’ use of automation in the financial reporting process is associated with a reduction in internal control material weaknesses. This association is consistent in a levels analysis with firm and year fixed effects, in a changes analysis, and in a propensity score matched difference-in-differences analysis. Second, I find evidence which suggests that monitoring of the financial reporting process decreases after automation, likely because of a perception that automation reduces the need for monitoring vis-à-vis stronger internal controls. Specifically, automation is associated with higher external audit fees and audit committee meetings in the initial years after a firm implements automation but associated with lower external audit fees and audit committee meetings in subsequent years. I also find evidence which suggests that this decreased monitoring may be costly: when internal control failures do happen for firms with automation, the failures are more material, as proxied by stronger negative market reactions. In aggregate, my evidence provides nuanced insights regarding whether automation technology improves financial reporting."
Automation in business research: systematic literature review,"Automation has profoundly transformed the operational landscape of companies across various industries. As organizations strive to adapt to this rapidly evolving technology, it becomes crucial for practitioners worldwide to identify the most suitable automation tools and solutions for their unique business needs. A systematic literature review serves as a valuable tool to gain a deeper understanding of the historical context of automation and to explore previous findings in this field. This study aims to provide an extensive literary overview of the history of automation spanning the years from 1966 to 2021. In this research, a combination of bibliometric, conceptual, and theoretical network analysis methodologies are employed, with the aid of VOSviewer software, to analyze and visualize the patterns within the existing body of automation literature. By utilizing bibliometric analysis, this study will map the key scholarly contributions and identify the main research themes and concepts. The findings of this systematic literature review will provide insights into the historical progression of automation research and its interdisciplinary nature, highlighting the significant milestones, emerging trends, and knowledge gaps in the field. Building upon these findings, the study will propose a research agenda to advance the scholarly debate on automation."
How do humans learn about the reliability of automation?,"In a range of settings, human operators make decisions with the assistance of automation, the reliability of which can vary depending upon context. Currently, the processes by which humans track the level of reliability of automation are unclear. In the current study, we test cognitive models of learning that could potentially explain how humans track automation reliability. We fitted several alternative cognitive models to a series of participants’ judgements of automation reliability observed in a maritime classification task in which participants were provided with automated advice. We examined three experiments including eight between-subjects conditions and 240 participants in total. Our results favoured a two-kernel delta-rule model of learning, which specifies that humans learn by prediction error, and respond according to a learning rate that is sensitive to environmental volatility. However, we found substantial heterogeneity in learning processes across participants. These outcomes speak to the learning processes underlying how humans estimate automation reliability and thus have implications for practice."
Driver behavior while using Level 2 vehicle automation: a hybrid naturalistic study,"Vehicle automation is becoming more prevalent. Understanding how drivers use this technology and its safety implications is crucial. In a 6–8 week naturalistic study, we leveraged a hybrid naturalistic driving research design to evaluate driver behavior with Level 2 vehicle automation, incorporating unique naturalistic and experimental control conditions. Our investigation covered four main areas: automation usage, system warnings, driving demand, and driver arousal, as well as secondary task engagement. While on the interstate, drivers were advised to engage Level 2 automation whenever they deemed it safe, and they complied by using it over 70% of the time. Interestingly, the frequency of system warnings increased with prolonged use, suggesting an evolving relationship between drivers and the automation features. Our data also revealed that drivers were discerning in their use of automation, opting for manual control under high driving demand conditions. Contrary to common safety concerns, our data indicated no significant rise in driver fatigue or fidgeting when using automation, compared to a control condition. Additionally, observed patterns of engagement in secondary tasks like radio listening and text messaging challenge existing assumptions about automation leading to dangerous driver distraction. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the conditions under which drivers opt to use automation and reveal a nuanced behavioral profile that emerges when automation is in use."
Automation and unemployment: help is on the way,"This paper examines the evolution of unemployment in a task-based model that allows for two types of technical change. One is automation, which turns labor tasks into mechanized ones. The second is addition of new labor tasks, which increases specialization, as in the expanding variety literature. The paper shows that in equilibrium the unemployment caused by automation converges to zero over time."
The impact of automation and optimization on customer experience: a consumer perspective,"The adoption of digital technologies has significantly transformed businesses and society as a whole. The automation of tasks is leading to changes in organizational structures and strategies. Due to technological growth, users are able to identify the benefits and risks that technology can entail in the purchasing process. Specifically, robotic process automation (RPA) can improve efficiency and agility in a company, which in turn can positively impact consumer satisfaction and engagement. However, automation can also negatively affect the consumer experience and service quality if not applied correctly. Therefore, this research focuses on analyzing the impact of automation technologies on purchasing processes and consumer satisfaction. For this purpose, a survey was developed by means of the Likert 5-point scale, which allowed for obtaining 215 valid responses from consumers in the Community of Madrid. The data were processed through the SPSS tool, which enabled the analysis of the data and the proposed model. Consequently, the results show that potential RPA-based automation and optimization of processes can be of great utility for businesses to better address investment for improving consumer satisfaction. In addition, it should be highlighted that this research contributes in an original way to the area of information and communication technologies by allowing for the development of proactive technological implementation plans that consider end-user satisfaction."
The fine line between automation and augmentation in website usability evaluation,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming widespread in all aspects of society, bringing benefits to the whole economy. There is a growing understanding of the potential benefits and risks of this type of technology. While the benefits are more efficient decision processes and industrial productivity, the risks may include a potential progressive disengagement of human beings in crucial aspects of decision-making. In this respect, a new perspective is emerging that aims at reconsidering the centrality of human beings while reaping the benefits of AI systems to augment rather than replace professional skills: Human-Centred AI (HCAI) is a novel framework that posits that high levels of human control do not contradict high levels of computer automation. In this paper, we investigate the two antipodes, automation vs augmentation, in the context of website usability evaluation. Specifically, we have analyzed whether the level of automation provided by a tool for semi-automatic usability evaluation can support evaluators in identifying usability problems. Three different visualizations, each one corresponding to a different level of automation, ranging from a full-automation approach to an augmentation approach, were compared in an experimental study. We found that a fully automated approach could help evaluators detect a significant number of medium and high-severity usability problems, which are the most critical in a software system; however, it also emerged that it was possible to detect more low-severity usability problems using one of the augmented approaches proposed in this paper."
IoT based applications for healthcare and home automation,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that involves connecting the virtual world of the Internet to the real world through so-called smart objects. Indeed, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are extensively employed in a wide range of applications, including healthcare field and home automation. These objects are equipped with communication capabilities and can exchange data over the Internet. In recent times, the healthcare sector has witnessed a surge of growth and transformation. The integration of IoT-enabled devices has revolutionized remote monitoring in healthcare, empowering healthcare providers to keep their patients safe and healthy while delivering exceptional care. On the other hand, the home automation system is becoming increasingly popular due to its many benefits, which involve remotely monitoring and controlling household appliances. In fact, the main challenges faced by home automation systems are poor manageability, rigidity, difficulty in achieving security, and high ownership costs. As the internet and its applications continue to grow, there is enormous potential for remotely accessing, controlling and monitoring network-enabled devices. With this context in mind, the objective of this project is to develop two IoT-based models. These models are based on Arduino and Raspberry pi boards, cloud, Bluetooth and ZigBee protocols. The first model is an IoT healthcare system that employs various sensors to collect heart rate and motion data. The second model is a home automation system that utilizes a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity levels, a MQ2 sensor to detect gas leaks, and an ultrasonic sensor to control the garage door's opening and closing. Both systems are built around an Arduino or a Raspberry pi microcontrollers integrated with an Android mobile application to process and transmit data via Bluetooth or Zigbee ensuring that the mobile app receives real-time updates."
Speed of environmental change frames relative ecological risk in climate change and climate intervention scenarios,"Stratospheric aerosol injection is a potential method of climate intervention to reduce climate risk as decarbonization efforts continue. However, possible ecosystem impacts from the strategic design of hypothetical intervention scenarios are poorly understood. Two recent Earth system model simulations depict policy-relevant stratospheric aerosol injection scenarios with similar global temperature targets, but a 10-year delay in intervention deployment. Here we show this delay leads to distinct ecological risk profiles through climate speeds, which describe the rate of movement of thermal conditions. On a planetary scale, climate speeds in the simulation where the intervention maintains temperature are not statistically distinguishable from preindustrial conditions. In contrast, rapid temperature reduction following delayed deployment produces climate speeds over land beyond either a preindustrial baseline or no-intervention climate change with present policy. The area exposed to threshold climate speeds places different scenarios in context to their relative ecological risks. Our results support discussion of tradeoffs and timescales in future scenario design and decision-making."
Increase in concerns about climate change following climate strikes and civil disobedience in Germany,"Climate movements have gained momentum in recent years, aiming to create public awareness of the consequences of climate change through salient climate protests. This paper investigates whether concerns about climate change increase following demonstrative protests and confrontational acts of civil disobedience. Leveraging individual-level survey panel data from Germany, we exploit exogenous variations in the timing of climate protests relative to survey interview dates to compare climate change concerns in the days before and after a protest (N = 24,535). Following climate protests, we find increases in concerns about climate change by, on average, 1.2 percentage points. Further, we find no statistically significant evidence that concerns of any subpopulation decreased after climate protests. Lastly, the increase in concerns following protests is highest when concern levels before the protests are low."
"AI-enabled strategies for climate change adaptation: protecting communities, infrastructure, and businesses from the impacts of climate change","Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges we face today. The impacts of rising temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events are already being felt around the world and are only expected to worsen in the coming years. To mitigate and adapt to these impacts, we need innovative, data-driven solutions. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for climate change adaptation, offering a range of capabilities that can help identify vulnerable areas, simulate future climate scenarios, and assess risks and opportunities for businesses and infrastructure. With the ability to analyze large volumes of data from climate models, satellite imagery, and other sources, AI can provide valuable insights that can inform decision-making and help us prepare for the impacts of climate change. However, the use of AI in climate change adaptation also raises important ethical considerations and potential biases that must be addressed. As we continue to develop and deploy these solutions, it is crucial to ensure that they are transparent, fair, and equitable. In this context, this article explores the latest innovations and future directions in AI-enabled climate change adaptation strategies, highlighting both the potential benefits and the ethical considerations that must be considered. By harnessing the power of AI for climate change adaptation, we can work towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable future for all."
Changing how you look at climate change: attention bias modification increases attention to climate change,"Mitigating the negative impacts of anthropogenic climate change is among the most serious and pressing challenges facing the global community. Despite the severity of the issue, there seems to be a lack of attention paid to climate change in our daily lives. Yet, climate change-related information can capture observers’ attention, and when attention is drawn to a particular environmental risk, the perceived severity of this attended risk is enhanced. The question then is whether attention to climate change-related information can be modified or enhanced. Here, we report the results of two experiments using single-session attention bias modification training procedures designed to increase attentional focus on climate change-related information. In Experiment 1, attention training to emotionally positive images of climate change (e.g., potential solutions such as windmills and solar panels) increased attention to these images, but not emotionally negative images of climate change (e.g., air pollution, natural disasters, and melting ice). In Experiment 2, this effect was replicated. In addition, Experiment 2 revealed that training to emotionally negative images of climate change increased attention to negative images of climate change, and there was a trend for this enhanced attention to generalize to positive images of climate change. Furthermore, attention training towards negative images of climate change enhanced self-reported levels of concern about climate change. Collectively, our results suggest that attention training can increase the allocation of attention to climate change-related information and, under certain training conditions, concern for climate change increases."
Are transport networks in low-income countries prepared for climate change? Barriers to preparing for climate change in Africa and South Asia,"Climate change, through extreme weather events and slow onset climatic changes, disrupts the operation of transport networks, and those in low-income countries (LICs) across Africa and South Asia are particularly vulnerable to climate change. This paper explores the barriers that LICs face across Africa and South Asia regarding preparedness of transport infrastructure to climate change, with the intent of addressing the knowledge gaps and consequential needs of LICs to support the delivery of more climate-resilient transport. Literature on climate change adaptation and transport resilience among LICs is reviewed to identify the broad challenges and barriers regarding climate change adaptation. Semi-structured interviews with 13 transport stakeholders across Africa and South Asia were also conducted to understand the challenges specific to the transport sector in the regions. Several barriers were identified, including a lack of data and knowledge on climate change impacts, design and prioritisation of remedial actions, budgeting and planning for climate change, and identifying and engaging with stakeholders. Findings from this paper and the wider research project it comprises inform policy guidance that calls for greater national and international coordination to develop practical, relevant and usable data, tools, advice and support for some of the most at-risk transport networks to climate change in the world."
Leveraging neuroscience for climate change research,"Anthropogenic climate change poses a substantial threat to societal living conditions. Here, we argue that neuroscience can substantially contribute to the fight against climate change and provide a framework and a roadmap to organize and prioritize neuroscience research in this domain. We outline how neuroscience can be used to: (1) investigate the negative impact of climate change on the human brain; (2) identify ways to adapt; (3) understand the neural substrates of decisions with pro-environmental and harmful outcomes; and (4) create neuroscience-based insights into communication and intervention strategies that aim to promote climate action. The paper is also a call to action for neuroscientists to join broader scientific efforts to tackle the existential environmental threats Earth is currently facing."
Maritime cybersecurity: protecting digital seas,"Increasing digitisation in the maritime domain and the intensive use of information technologies have become essential for the effective functioning of systems that manage navigation, communications, sensors and weapons throughout the maritime chain. In this context, the issuance and enforcement of international standards and policies are seeking to mitigate the appearance of threats and vulnerabilities that aim to compromise access to functionalities, on-board systems and network integrity. Thus, in this article, we first review the main proposals for guidelines, frameworks and other solutions related to cybersecurity in the maritime environment. Subsequently, we analyse the way in which cybersecurity challenges specific to systems and equipment in this particular environment are addressed, identifying the main cybersecurity weaknesses and needs in the maritime environment that are not completely addressed. Based on this analysis, we then propose the structure of POSEIDON, a comprehensive framework for managing cybersecurity in maritime environments that addresses the identified gaps. This cybersecurity management framework takes into account existing proposals and is complemented by a set of new elements to provide a comprehensive approach to addressing the weaknesses identified."
More than malware: unmasking the hidden risk of cybersecurity regulations,"Cybersecurity investments are made within a complex and ever-evolving environment, where regulatory changes represent a significant risk factor. While cybersecurity regulations aim to minimize cyber risks and enhance protection, the uncertainty arising from frequent changes or new regulations can significantly impact organizational response strategies. This paper explores the determinants and implications of regulatory risks associated with cybersecurity, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of how these risks influence strategic decision-making. The study delves into the suggestion of preventive and mitigative controls that enable businesses to adapt to and mitigate potential disruptions caused by regulatory changes, thereby preserving their established cybersecurity practices. Another key contribution of this study is the introduction of a stochastic econometric model that illustrates how regulatory risks and uncertainties can affect investment behaviors, often prompting a “wait-and-see” stance. This model synthesizes the complex relationship among investment choices, regulatory changes, and cybersecurity risks, providing insights into the dynamic nature of cybersecurity investment strategies. The research findings offer valuable guidance for risk management and strategic planning in cybersecurity investments. By comprehensively understanding the drivers and impacts of regulatory risks, businesses and policymakers can develop more effective risk evaluation and management approaches. This is essential for sustaining a strong cybersecurity posture while navigating the changing regulatory environment."
Cybersecurity knowledge graphs construction and quality assessment,"Cyber-attack activities are complex and ever-changing, posing severe challenges to cybersecurity personnel. Introducing knowledge graphs into the field of cybersecurity helps depict the intricate cybersecurity landscape and provides technical support for threat identification and situational awareness. However, during the process of constructing knowledge graphs, inevitable noise and conflicts may be introduced, leading to misleading inferences and decisions. This paper aims to address the issues of constructing and assessing the quality of cybersecurity knowledge graphs. We manually constructed a dataset of cybersecurity knowledge graphs (CS13K) and expanded the existing cybersecurity ontology, building a more versatile ontology applicable to existing data features. Building upon this, we utilized Neo4j to construct the cybersecurity knowledge graph. Furthermore, we propose an AttTucker model, based on Transformer, for assessing the quality of knowledge graphs. By employing numerous self-attention heads, this model captures latent information among entities and relations. While reducing the dimensionality of knowledge embeddings, the model achieves evaluation results comparable to high-dimensional embeddings. Finally, we incorporate the path-level information between entities in the knowledge graph into the evaluation of knowledge graph quality based on the AttTucker model. Experimental analysis on both generic datasets and cybersecurity datasets demonstrates that our model significantly improves F1 value and accuracy in knowledge graph quality assessment tasks, outperforming other models."
Cybersecurity knowledge graphs,"Cybersecurity knowledge graphs, which represent cyber-knowledge with a graph-based data model, provide holistic approaches for processing massive volumes of complex cybersecurity data derived from diverse sources. They can assist security analysts to obtain cyberthreat intelligence, achieve a high level of cyber-situational awareness, discover new cyber-knowledge, visualize networks, data flow, and attack paths, and understand data correlations by aggregating and fusing data. This paper reviews the most prominent graph-based data models used in this domain, along with knowledge organization systems that define concepts and properties utilized in formal cyber-knowledge representation for both background knowledge and specific expert knowledge about an actual system or attack. It is also discussed how cybersecurity knowledge graphs enable machine learning and facilitate automated reasoning over cyber-knowledge."
Recommender Systems in Cybersecurity,"With the growth of CyberTerrorism, enterprises worldwide have been struggling to stop intruders from obtaining private data. Despite the efforts made by Cybersecurity experts, the shortage of skillful security teams and the usage of intelligent attacks have slowed down the enhancement of defense mechanisms. Furthermore, the pandemic in 2020 forced organizations to work in remote environments with poor security, leading to increased cyberattacks. One possible solution for these problems is the implementation of Recommender Systems to assist Cybersecurity human operators. Our goal is to survey the application of Recommender Systems in Cybersecurity architectures. These decision-support tools deal with information overload through filtering and prioritization methods, allowing businesses to increase revenue, achieve better user satisfaction, and make faster and more efficient decisions in various domains (e-commerce, healthcare, finance, and other fields). Several reports demonstrate the potential of using these recommendation structures to enhance the detection and prevention of cyberattacks and aid Cybersecurity experts in treating client incidents. This survey discusses several studies where Recommender Systems are implemented in Cybersecurity with encouraging results. One promising direction explored by the community is using Recommender Systems as attack predictors and navigation assistance tools. As contributions, we show the recent efforts in this area and summarize them in a table. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of potential research lines. For example, the inclusion of Recommender Systems in security information event management systems and security orchestration, automation, and response applications could decrease their complexity and information overload."
Design tactics for tailoring transformer architectures to cybersecurity challenges,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats, effective defense strategies are crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and critical systems. Deep learning methods, notably the Transformer architecture, have shown immense potential in addressing cybersecurity challenges. However, customizing, and adapting Transformer architectures for cybersecurity applications presents a challenge, demanding the utilization of effective strategies to achieve optimal performance. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of design tactics employed in tailoring Transformer architectures specifically for cybersecurity problems. Design tactics, defined as strategic solutions to architectural challenges based on well-justified design decisions, are explored in-depth within the context of cybersecurity. By examining the modifications and adaptations made to the original Transformer architecture, this study unveils the design decisions and strategies crucial for successful implementation in diverse cybersecurity domains. The findings emphasize the significance of aligning design tactics with the unique business requirements and quality factors of each specific application domain. This study contributes valuable insights into the utilization of design tactics for customizing Transformer architectures in cybersecurity, paving the way for enhanced defense strategies against the dynamic and evolving nature of cyber threats."
Spreading cybersecurity awareness via gamification: zero-day game,"This research project aims to increase the employees' cybersecurity awareness by proposing a training program that consists of pre-game and post-game phishing attacks, pre-game and post-game surveys, and an interactive zero-day game with embedded threat scenarios. Furthermore, we propose five flowcharts that simulate common cyberattacks. The zero-day game consists of five levels. The first level trains employees in using complex passwords. Two levels cover the social engineering attacks: one level trains employees about suspicious links and online survey tricks, while the other level trains players about the organization's security policies. The fourth level educates employees about malware spread via repackaged fake applications. The last level educates employees about phishing email attacks. Furthermore, we developed a chatbot inside the game to aid users in playing the different game levels. Additionally, two surveys and two phishing attacks are carried out to assess the employees' knowledge level of cybersecurity threats. The zero-day cybersecurity awareness program is applied to twenty-three employees. Experimental results indicate that the zero-day cybersecurity awareness program is more engaging and effective than traditional awareness programs. Results also indicate that the proposed program accurately measures and improves the employees' cybersecurity awareness level."
Should firms invest more in cybersecurity?,"We combine unique survey data on IT use and administrative tax record data on Dutch firms to understand how cybersecurity investments relate to the probability of cyber incidents and firm profitability. This dataset allows us to control for firm size, industry, and IT organization. We construct a new indicator to measure the degree of cyber maturity of firms and find that this maturity level tends to increase with firm size. Regression analyses suggest that the relation between maturity level and probability of a cyber incident is inverted U-shaped: a higher maturity level is initially associated with a higher incident probability, but the highest maturity level is associated with fewer reported incidents. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that basic cybersecurity measures enable better detection of incidents and more sophisticated measures help to prevent incidents. We do not find, however, evidence for a positive relation between cybersecurity measures and profits."
Perceptions of organizational responsibility for cybersecurity in Saudi Arabia: a moderated mediation analysis,"The study aims to explore the crucial interaction between organizational responsibility and employee behavior in cybersecurity, particularly in the distinct setting of Saudi Arabia. It investigates how organizational responsibility perceptions impact employee attitudes and practices towards cybersecurity. The research utilizes a mixed theoretical framework, incorporating stewardship theory, protection motivation theory, and the theory of planned behavior. It examines the intricate link between organizational leadership, policies, and individual responses to cybersecurity threats through a comprehensive survey conducted among Saudi employees. The study discovers that employees’ perceptions of organizational responsibility greatly influence their cybersecurity behavior. It also finds that employee attitudes towards cybersecurity act as a mediator in this relationship. Contrary to expectations, personal experiences with cybersecurity incidents do not significantly moderate these relationships. This underlines the complex and culture-specific nature of cybersecurity compliance in organizational contexts. This research uniquely contributes to the understanding of cybersecurity behavior within organizations, particularly highlighting the need for policies that align with both organizational objectives and individual behaviors in culturally specific environments like Saudi Arabia. It offers novel insights into the less pronounced impact of personal cybersecurity experiences on organizational-employee dynamics in cybersecurity compliance."
How the three lines of defense can contribute to public firms’ cybersecurity effectiveness,"This interpretative field study examines how public firms deal with cybersecurity-related issues, emphasizing how the three lines of defense can contribute to cybersecurity effectiveness. Sixteen interviews were conducted with 18 participants, including 13 executives/senior managers in internal audit, information technology (IT), and information security (IS) in 13 different public firms. The many cybersecurity structures, processes, or relational mechanisms established by the three lines of defense in the participating organizations are identified. These governance mechanisms are used as a baseline for analyzing how teams in internal audit, IT, IS, cybersecurity, legal, finance, corporate communications, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) are engaged and collaborate in dealing with cybersecurity-related issues. This study entered into the “black box” to document how different organizational functions are involved in IT/IS governance mechanisms associated with cybersecurity. Findings can help board of directors and management reflect on the nature of cybersecurity activities that could be implemented to enhance cybersecurity effectiveness. Regulators may consider the issues raised by participants to clarify regulations about cybersecurity disclosure."
Towards NICE-by-Design Cybersecurity Learning Environments: A Cyber Range for SOC Teams,"Cybersecurity has become an increasingly important field as cyber threats continue to grow in number and complexity. The NICE framework, developed by NIST, provides a structured approach to cybersecurity education. Despite the publication of cybersecurity frameworks, scenario design in cybersecurity is not yet governed by structured design principles, leading to ambiguous learning outcomes. This research uses the NICE framework to provide structure design and development of a cyber range and the relevant scenarios. The proposed methodology and research results can assist the scenario design in cybersecurity and as a methodological procedure for evaluation. Finally, the research provides a better understanding of the NICE framework and demonstrates how it can assist in creating practical cybersecurity scenarios."
Cybersecurity considerations for radiology departments involved with artificial intelligence,"Radiology artificial intelligence (AI) projects involve the integration of integrating numerous medical devices, wireless technologies, data warehouses, and social networks. While cybersecurity threats are not new to healthcare, their prevalence has increased with the rise of AI research for applications in radiology, making them one of the major healthcare risks of 2021. Radiologists have extensive experience with the interpretation of medical imaging data but radiologists may not have the required level of awareness or training related to AI-specific cybersecurity concerns. Healthcare providers and device manufacturers can learn from other industry sector industries that have already taken steps to improve their cybersecurity systems. This review aims to introduce cybersecurity concepts as it relates to medical imaging and to provide background information on general and healthcare-specific cybersecurity challenges. We discuss approaches to enhancing the level and effectiveness of security through detection and prevention techniques, as well as ways that technology can improve security while mitigating risks. We first review general cybersecurity concepts and regulatory issues before examining these topics in the context of radiology AI, with a specific focus on data, training, data, training, implementation, and auditability. Finally, we suggest potential risk mitigation strategies. By reading this review, healthcare providers, researchers, and device developers can gain a better understanding of the potential risks associated with radiology AI projects, as well as strategies to improve cybersecurity and reduce potential associated risks.Clinical Relevance StatementThis review can aid radiologists’ and related professionals’ understanding of the potential cybersecurity risks associated with radiology AI projects, as well as strategies to improve security.Key Points• Embarking on a radiology artificial intelligence (AI) project is complex and not without risk especially as cybersecurity threats have certainly become more abundant in the healthcare industry.• Fortunately healthcare providers and device manufacturers have the advantage of being able to take inspiration from other industry sectors who are leading the way in the field.• Herein we provide an introduction to cybersecurity as it pertains to radiology, a background to both general and healthcare-specific cybersecurity challenges; we outline general approaches to improving security through both detection and preventative techniques, and instances where technology can increase security while mitigating risks.Graphical Abstract"
Cybersecurity disclosure in the banking industry: a comparative study,"The recurrence of cyberattacks on businesses in the last decade has attracted significant attention from policy makers and market participants to the importance of corporations’ responsibility and transparency on cybersecurity. In this study, we investigate cybersecurity disclosure made by the 48 largest Canadian and US banks from 2014 to 2020, using an exploratory qualitative approach. The banking industry has been a major target of cyberattacks due to the critical data that it contains. We first develop an index based on previous literature, current policies on cybersecurity disclosure and consultation with academics and practitioners. We then use the index to manually code bank reports related to cybersecurity. Afterward, we investigate the content of the disclosures in detail and discuss the level of compliance with the index. We then critically discuss banks’ disclosure behaviors using proprietary cost, signaling and legitimacy theories and provide recommendations for policy makers and other stakeholders."
Deep learning techniques to detect cybersecurity attacks: a systematic mapping study,"ContextRecent years have seen a lot of attention into Deep Learning (DL) techniques used to detect cybersecurity attacks. DL techniques can swiftly analyze massive datasets, and automate the detection and mitigation of a wide variety of cybersecurity attacks with superior results. However, no systematic study exists that summarizes these DL techniques since most studies are informal literature surveys or focus on different subjects.ObjectiveTo deliver a comprehensive and systematic summary of the existing DL techniques used to detect cybersecurity attacks as they are described in the literature. To identify open challenges for future research.MethodWe conducted a systematic mapping study about DL techniques to detect cybersecurity attacks driven by eleven research questions. We followed existing guidelines when defining our research protocol to increase the repeatability and reliability of our results.ResultsFrom an initial set of 1839 papers, we identified 116 relevant primary studies, primarily published in the last three years. We investigated multiple aspects of the DL techniques, such as the cybersecurity attack types to detect, their application domains, the programming languages, libraries, operating systems, and frameworks used to implement the DL techniques, the datasets used to train the DL models, the types of research carried out (academic or industrial), the performance of the techniques, and the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. We present a new taxonomy comprising 36 different DL techniques. We identified 14 application domains, eight cybersecurity attacks, and 93 publicly available datasets, among other results.ConclusionsWe provide six lessons learned along with recommendations for future research directions. The most active research areas in DL techniques for the identification of cybersecurity attacks discuss CNN and LSTM techniques. DL techniques in cybersecurity is a rapidly growing and developing research area, with many open challenges, including the lack of (a) research conducted in industrial settings, (b) real-time datasets, (c) studies focusing on promising DL techniques and relevant cybersecurity attacks."
The Role of Culture on Islamic Finance: A Comparative Analysis from Islamic Finance Permitting Countries,"Despite the inclusion of cultural elements in hundreds of business and management research studies, there have been relatively few studies in finance, and Islamic finance just recently seems to have discovered the impact of culture. Through this study, culture has been proposed as the next possible means to improve the Islamic finance industry. By utilizing data from 2012 to 2019, this paper aims to empirically examine the effects of culture, proxied by education, on Islamic finance in 45 Islamic finance-permitting countries by using generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators. We find significant effects of culture in Islamic finance in all regions except for developed countries and other Arab countries, which are still in their infancy in the field of Islamic finance. Developed countries need to change their educational system in Islamic finance to reflect the real, Shariah-based ethics of Islam rather than secular humanism, while other Arab countries should pay more attention to the Islamic finance industry. Thus, it is important to consider the culture and open the door to the new discipline of “Islamic cultural finance” in the development of the Islamic finance industry."
Islamic finance and governance indicators: empirical evidence from Islamic finance-permitting countries,"Despite being greatly progressive for more than 45 years covering even Muslim minority countries, the development of Islamic finance in some countries is not supported by well-established governance. This paper aims to empirically re-examine the effects of the governance components on Islamic finance in 45 Islamic finance-permitting countries. The study utilizes the dynamic panel GMM approach from the data spanning from 2012 to 2019. We find insignificant effect of regulation in Islamic finance in the region of developed countries, Muslim minority countries, and other Arab countries. We also find that corporate governance is not statistically significant in MENA and non-Asian countries. These results reinforce the need for a new type of regulation based on product requirements, policies, and procedures. Thus, the governance indicators can be understood by the wider world and assist in gaining more acceptance for the Islamic finance industry."
Does green finance policy promote green total factor productivity? Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment in the green finance pilot zone,"The establishment of Green Finance Reform and Innovation Pilot Zones represents a novel endeavor aimed at paving a “bottom-up” pathway for the advancement of green finance and, consequently, holds immense significance in fostering economic growth that is environmentally sustainable. Drawing on data spanning the years 2013–2019 from 278 prefecture-level cities across China, we delve into the influence of the Green Finance Reform and Innovation Pilot policy on urban Green Total Factor Productivity. We found that: Firstly, the Green Finance Reform and Innovation Pilot policy has demonstrated a discernible enhancement in Green Total Factor Productivity within the designated pilot regions. Secondly, there is heterogeneity in the promotion effect of this pilot policy on Green Total Factor Productivity. As the geographical advantage and economic development level decrease, this promotional effect gradually diminishes. Thirdly, it is evident that the Green Finance Reform and Innovation Pilot policy primarily elevates Green Total Factor Productivity in the pilot regions by improving resource allocation efficiency, fostering innovation in green technologies, and facilitating the upgrading of industrial structures. This research not only underscores the efficacy of green finance in the context of economic transition but also provides empirical substantiation for the strategic utilization of pilot zones to propel nationwide initiatives aimed at sustainable green development.Graphical abstract"
Green digital finance and technology diffusion,"Technology diffusion is essential for sustainable development. However, traditional financing faces structural problems in supporting technological innovation and diffusion. Fortunately, greening and digitalisation have become important directions for the financial development. It’s well worth examining whether green digital finance would promote the diffusion of technology among regions. Therefore, this study explores the causal relationship between green digital finance and technology diffusion using the panel data of 35,532 ‘citing city-cited city’ pair observations from 2002 to 2015. Considering different spatial spillover effects of administrative boundaries and geographic distances, it applies and extends the classic spatial Dubin model with a dual-weighted boundary and distance. The main findings of this study are as follows. First, green digital finance shows significant and considerable spatial stimulus effects, particularly in terms of spatial diffusion across cities. A slight cumulative phenomenon is revealed for different technology diffusion durations. Green digital credit, investment, and support have better stimulating effects on technology diffusion. Second, digital economy and market integration are effective mechanism pathways during this stimulating process of green digital finance on technology diffusion. Digitalisation innovation has a better mechanism effect than others. Third, considering the direction of technology diffusion, the diffusion effect from the east-region cities was better than that from the central-west-region cities."
"Households’ coping mechanisms with droughts and floods using finance, non-finance and the social safety net measures: evidence from Kenya","This study analysed households’ use of formal and informal finance, non-finance livelihood diversification and the social safety net measures in coping with droughts and floods. It employed a cross-sectional survey of 1370 households across 27 counties in Kenya that are prone to droughts and floods. Bivariate probit regressions reveal that households employ multiple coping measures related to finance, the social safety net and non-finance choices. The use of coping measures vary by household income, household dependency ratio, geographic and agro-climatic contexts, as well as the household head’s age and educational attainment. Further, the findings reveal that the use of the social safety net and non-finance coping mechanisms demonstrate complementarities in coping with droughts, suggesting that opportunities to benefit from the social safety net do not dampen livelihood diversification initiatives by the households. Additionally, households in arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) depend to a large extent on the social safety net and non-finance livelihood diversification coping mechanisms, signalling the need to explore ways that encourage private sector development in promoting market-oriented coping strategies."
How does digital finance encourage the use of renewable energy in China? Inverse relationships from green finance,"A promising approach forfacilitating China’s shift towards renewable energy sources entails combining digital finance and green financing. The present research investigates the supply chains and reverse logistics of significant financial indices, including the S&P Green Bond Index, the MSCI Global Markets Index, and the S&P Global Renewable Energy Index. The analysis encompasses the period from the creation of these indices on September 28, 2008, through January 12, 2022. To minimize risk, portfolios have increasingly adopted diverse indices, such as the S&P Global Clean Energy Index and the S&P Green Bond Index. This study investigates the intricate relationship between green financing and digital finance, shedding light on their combined impact on the uptake of renewable energy in China. This study examines the role of digital financial technologies, including blockchain, mobile payment systems, and big data analytics, in enhancing the accessibility of green financing choices for renewable energy projects. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature and empirical research is conducted to achieve this objective. The results emphasize the significant progress in improving financial inclusion, risk management, and transparency by integrating green financing and digital finance. As mentioned earlier, the enhancements have significantly enhanced the level of trust and assurance among investors operating within the renewable energy industry. Moreover, the report highlights the crucial need for continuous governmental backing and financial investments in digital financial infrastructure to drive China towards a more environmentally friendly and sustainable energy framework."
"Applications of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Finance—a systematic review of Finance, Information Systems, and Computer Science literature","Digitalization and technologization affect numerous domains, promising advantages but also entailing risks. Hence, when decision-makers in highly-regulated domains like Finance implement these technological advances—especially Artificial Intelligence—regulators prescribe high levels of transparency, assuring the traceability of decisions for third parties. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is of tremendous importance in this context. We provide an overview of current research on XAI in Finance with a systematic literature review screening 2,022 articles from leading Finance, Information Systems, and Computer Science outlets. We identify a set of 60 relevant articles, classify them according to the used XAI methods and goals that they aim to achieve, and provide an overview of XAI methods used in different Finance areas. Areas like risk management, portfolio optimization, and applications around the stock market are well-researched, while anti-money laundering is understudied. Researchers implement both transparent models and post-hoc explainability, while they recently favored the latter."
Intelligent finance and change management implications,"Change management is the embodiment of an enterprise’s core competence. It provides competitive differentiation and effectively adapts to the ever-changing world.

The study examines the case of Ping An (Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd.), a leading insurance company in China that has successfully implemented intelligent finance and change management strategies. The paper begins with a literature review that provides an overview of the concept of intelligent finance, the relevance of change management in the context of intelligent finance, models, and frameworks for intelligent finance, and approaches to change management. The study then presents a case analysis of Ping An, including descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, regression analysis, and qualitative findings. The paper concludes with implications for practice and theory, contributions of the study, and recommendations for future research. Overall, this paper contributes to the growing literature on intelligent finance and change management and provides practical insights for organizations seeking to adopt intelligent finance."
Measurement and spatiotemporal characteristics of China’s green finance,"To study the extent of green finance development in China, this article constructs a green finance index system and employs the entropy value method to measure China’s green finance by using a yearly provincial panel data from 2001 to 2020. The Thiel and Moran indices are then used to systematically analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of China’s regional green finance. The findings are summarized as follows. Firstly, the overall green finance index in China experiences an upward trend. The development of green finance in the eastern region is superior to that in other regions in terms of absolute value and growth rate. Moreover, the differences in China’s green finance index have shown an increasing trend over the last two decades, which is mostly contributed by the intra-regional differences. Finally, the inter-regional distribution of green finance index demonstrates that green finance development has a spatial spillover effect."
Entrepreneurial finance and regional ecosystem emergence,"We present a novel framework for studying the evolving role of entrepreneurial finance over the stages of emergence for a regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. Drawing on entrepreneurial ecosystems, entrepreneurial finance, and territorial servitization, we explore how three different finance sources impact firm survival and how they relate to each other during ecosystem emergence. We analyze entrepreneurial firms in one industry and region over 36 years. We find that firm survival is differentially affected by funder type based on the stage of ecosystem emergence. Finance sources also have different interrelations depending on the stage of emergence. Based on our results, we abductively articulate a framework for stage-dependent ecosystem emergence microfoundations. This rectifies contradictory results that examine single sources of finance and use cross-sectional data. Had we not measured the emergence process, the results would have led to markedly different theoretical implications and practical takeaways for entrepreneurial finance and ecosystem emergence."
Municipal finance shapes urban climate action and justice,"Implementing climate policies and programmes in cities requires substantial investments that inevitably entangle climate action with urban climate finance—the mechanisms and practices city governments use to pay for climate efforts. Here we use US cities as a case study to examine how climate finance impacts, and is impacted by, the pursuit of urban climate action and climate justice. Drawing on 34 expert interviews, we show how municipal financial decisions and budgetary practices are shaping how, when and for whom cities are responding to climate change. We demonstrate how public spending decisions are intertwined with the logics of debt financing and examine the impacts of these relationships on cities’ climate investments. We showcase the structuring impacts of finance on climate action and the built environment, and we introduce pathways through which climate and justice considerations are already being integrated into, and potentially transforming, municipal finance in the United States."
Emerging new themes in green finance: a systematic literature review,"There is a need for an extensive understanding of the emerging themes and trends within the domain of green finance, which is still evolving. By conducting a systematic literature review on green finance, the purpose of this study is to identify the emerging themes that have garnered significant attention over the past 12 years. In order to identify the emerging themes in green finance, bibliometric analysis was performed on 978 publications that were published between 2011 and 2023 and were taken from the databases of Scopus and Web of Science. The author examined annual scientific production, journal distribution, countries scientific production, most relevant authors, most frequent words, areas where empirical research is lacking, words' frequency over time, trend topics, and themes of green finance. The outcome of the review identified the following seven themes: (i) green finance and environmental sustainability; (ii) green finance and investments; (iii) green finance and innovation; (iv) green finance policy/green credit guidelines; (v) green finance and economy; (vi) green finance and corporate social responsibility; (vii)trends/challenges/barriers/awareness of green finance. The analysis of these emerging themes will contribute to the existing corpus of knowledge and provide valuable insights into the landscape of green finance as it evolves."
"Digital finance, innovation transformation, and resilient city growth","Digital finance is a pivotal catalyst for a contemporary economic system and assumes a significant auxiliary function in the establishment of resilient urban centers. This study empirically examines the enabling influence of digital finance on resilient cities using panel data from 287 prefecture-level cities and above in China between 2011 and 2020. The analysis is based on the mechanisms of innovation and transformation. The importance of digital finance in facilitating the development of resilient cities has been observed, with a specific emphasis on its impact on enhancing the adaptive capacity and growth resilience of urban areas. The utilization of digital finance has the potential to expedite the process of transforming urban industrial structures, invigorating innovation and entrepreneurial activities, and serving as a significant catalyst for the development of resilient cities. The analysis of heterogeneity reveals that various aspects of digital finance have varying degrees of influence on urban resilience. Specifically, the depth of utilization of digital finance exerts the most significant impact, followed by the level of digitalization, while the extent of coverage has the least effect. Furthermore, when considering regional distribution, the promotion effect of digital finance on resilient cities diminishes gradually from the eastern to the central and western regions."
Breaking the chains of traditional finance: A taxonomy of decentralized finance business models,"Recently, the looming bankruptcy of Credit Suisse, which ultimately led to its merger with UBS, has intensified the discussion surrounding the need for more transparent and democratic financial markets. Decentralized finance (DeFi) represents a departure from traditional financial intermediation by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts. Despite its growing importance, limited research has been conducted on the business models of DeFi services. This study aims to address this gap by examining the business models of various DeFi services, identifying key drivers of innovation, differentiation, and value creation. Using a rigorous taxonomy development framework, we identify 12 dimensions and 47 characteristics that operationalize business models in DeFi. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the transformation of financial services through blockchain technology and provide valuable insights for DeFi entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers."
Modelling Climate Finance Flows in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Climate finance stakeholders across Africa have long sought to understand the complex nature of the climate cash flow architecture. Distribution models are critical mathematical tools for generating the general characteristics of the cash flow that are used to inform policy decisions. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive investigation of the climate funds flowing into sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by suggesting candidate climate finance models that can be used by policy makers to design simulations that can aid in assessing climate risks, identify more efficient climate finance schemes, and obtain optimal control parameter settings under different scenarios. This is achieved by considering climate finance as a form of insurance. Different dimensions of the data are examined following four distinct groupings of the data set. This is to account for different views of risk by the various climate finance participants. The frequency and severity of the approved funds are analyzed with the aid of various mathematical distribution models and regression analyses. The dynamics of a given variable relative to varying scenarios are examined. The findings obtained confirm the presence of emerging risks induced by the nature of the flow. Central Africa for instance records the lowest theme-specific projects and mitigation finance accounts for more than half of all the climate funds while sectoral-wise, adaptation finance is majorly concentrated in the energy sector. The perpetuation of the observed inequalities across the themes, subregions and sector-specific climate-related projects portends grave consequences as these risks begin to accumulate over time. The Burr mixture model best fitted the approved projects’ cost distribution and the factors driving the frequency and severity of approved projects ranged from Central Africa to projects in the general environment sector. One of the policy recommendations emphasized was the need to adopt a risk-adjusted distribution model for climate finance allocation in SSA."
Advancing green finance: a review of climate change and decarbonization,"This paper comprehensively reviews the interconnections between climate change, decarbonization, and green finance. The urgency of addressing climate change and its catastrophic consequences needs to focus on green finance as a vital tool in the global struggle against environmental damage. Green finance involves supplying investments, loans, or capital to support environmentally friendly activities, facilitating the transition to a more sustainable future. This review explores the theoretical frame of reference for green finance, including its impacts on climate change, decarbonization of economies, carbon-stranded assets, risk management, renewable energy, and sustainable economic growth. Additionally, it examines regional focuses in Asia, such as the importance of green finance in China and the beliefs and challenges of green finance in Bangladesh. The review also discusses future directions and recommendations for advancing green finance. The review examines the current research in green finance and how it can address environmental challenges and promote sustainable development. More research needs to be conducted in mainstream economics and finance journals to bridge the knowledge gap and foster broader scholarly engagement in green finance. Researchers, policymakers, investors, and stakeholders will receive help from the study's reliable and robust insights into combating climate change and promoting sustainable development."
Advancing green finance: a review of sustainable development,"This study comprehensively reviews the relationship between green finance and sustainable development, specifically focusing on combatting climate change and achieving carbon neutrality. Utilizing a narrative review methodology, the study examines a range of scholarly articles and publications to identify key themes, findings, and future directions in green finance. The review emphasizes the crucial role of substantial investments in green and low-carbon initiatives to address climate change effectively and promote sustainable economic growth. It highlights the necessity of robust regulatory frameworks that facilitate the availability of green finance and the integration of carbon–neutral practices. Additionally, the paper explores the potential of impact investing, wherein investors accept lower financial returns in exchange for non-financial benefits in green finance. It underscores the influential role of institutional ownership in guiding companies toward enhanced environmental and social performance. Moreover, integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment decisions is critical for sustainable finance. Addressing the intersection of climate change and risk management, the review highlights the implications of environmental risks on financial decision-making. Effective communication strategies can raise public awareness and support for climate policies. The study concludes by calling for collaboration, further research, and policy measures to advance green finance and foster sustainable economic growth. It recommends aligning financial incentives with sustainable outcomes, fostering transparency, and incorporating social equity in green finance initiatives to contribute towards achieving sustainable development goals and promoting a greener future."
Astronomy and Culture,"Modern astronomy as a field of inquiry may be shaped by what we consider the “scientific” ways of knowing. However, the history of astronomy as a human endeavour dates back millennia before the “modern” notions of “science”. This long history means that astronomy is, at its core, built on a rich cultural diversity and history. This offers a rich potential that, while having been examined in various studies, has yet to be explored from a contextual pedagogical perspective. This paper offers an initial exploratory theoretical perspective on how social semiotics can be used to inform a conceptual framework. This approach not only brings notions of culture into the teaching and learning of astronomy but uses culture as the starting point in a way that does justice to the cultural diversity of the discipline and the world. In doing so, this paper develops two frameworks: (i) the Conceptual Framework for Culture in Astronomy Education and (ii) the Pedagogical Framework for Culture in Astronomy Education, both of these offer a novel approach to astronomy education."
Direct and Indirect Opportunities to Learn Astronomy Within the Chilean Science Curriculum,"Astronomy has great potential to attract children toward science and improve their scientific literacy. However, it has a relatively small presence within the school curricula worldwide. In Chile, home of the world’s largest telescopes, astronomy is even more relevant in science education, but the presence of astronomical content within the national curriculum was not studied yet. In this context, this article characterizes the opportunities to learn astronomy within the Chilean science curriculum from grades 1 to 12. A mixed descriptive design with documental analysis is conducted to determine which science learning objectives (LOs) are directly or indirectly related to astronomy and classify them according to astronomical topics, cognitive processes, and Big Ideas in Astronomy. The proportion of LOs related to astronomy within the whole science curriculum and the categories of interest are calculated and compared over the school grades. The results show that the LOs directly related to astronomy are present only in a third of the grades and include a small variety of astronomical topics. Meanwhile, LOs indirectly related to astronomy appear in all grades and include more topics and higher cognitive processes. We discuss the implications of the outcomes and raise some possibilities to promote astronomy literacy through interdisciplinary work."

Subterahertz Astronomy in the Russian Federation: Prospects and Directions,"AbstractThis paper addresses the scientific and technical prospects and potential directions for the development of subterahertz astronomy in the Russian Federation. The concept of creating subterahertz instruments in the form of a universal compact antenna array for placement on the territory of the Russian Federation is proposed. It is possible to implement several space projects in the subterahertz range using such an antenna array, including a space interferometer and a telescope on the surface of the Moon. Ground-based compact antenna arrays will be able to act as a support for the very long baseline interferometer mode of the Millimetron observatory."
"Deep into the affinity spaces and authentic activities of astronomy camps: science teachers' interests, perceptions, and experiences","Camps are among the activities that teachers join in by taking full responsibility for their own ongoing development and eagerly following in accordance with their needs. This paper aims to demonstrate that the affinity space and authentic nature of astronomy camp activities provide teachers much more than expected. Therefore, the study will provide supporting evidence for developing a better understanding of the extent to which science teachers have an interest in astronomy, their perceptions about camp environments, and their learning experiences in such an atmosphere. The study employs both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The design of the study presents a statistical analysis of teachers' interest in astronomy using a validated scale and their perceptions using a semantic differentiation form, as well as interprets their experiences that stimulate this interest in astronomy and perception about camp environments through a qualitative analysis of teacher reflections and views on activities. Findings show that the social context of the camp is constructed by a selected group of individuals who have an interest in the camp and attach high-level meanings to it. And their views on activities reveal meaningful experiences that varied depending on the camp's affinity space, as well as authentic activities to support their development. In summary, the current study contributes to the growing body of evidence that affinity spaces and the authentic nature of the outdoor camp activities provide valuable experiences for teacher development."
Disentropy in astronomy,"Astronomers often have to deal with randomness. For example, stars and radio telescopes are sources of randomness. On the other hand, randomly distributed stars in some astronomical images can make harder the task of an algorithm that aims the automatic identification of important structures in the image. Therefore, a randomness measure, like the disentropy of the autocorrelation function, can be a useful mathematical tool for astronomers. In this direction, in the present work we firstly show three applications of the disentropy of the autocorrelation in astronomy. Initially, we calculate the randomness of the images of cosmic microwave background maps produced by Planck satellite, providing for the first time a numerical value for that randomness. Following, we use the disentropy to build an algorithm that erases parts of astronomical images with large randomness, what is particularly useful to remove background stars. In the third application, the disentropy of the autocorrelation is used to calculate the randomness of the signal of a radio pulsar used as random number generator. At last, we used the relative disentropy as distance measure between probability distributions in order to find the parameters of the probability density function of the flux density of a pulsar."
Cultural diversity and innovative entrepreneurship,"A growing empirical literature has established a positive relationship between cultural diversity and entrepreneurship, often attributing this effect to innovation benefits of diversity. However, not all entrepreneurship is inherently innovative, raising the question of whether cultural diversity may increase the likelihood of an entrepreneur pursuing an innovative instead of a more replicative business strategy. This study investigates the relationship between regional cultural diversity and the innovation orientation of early-stage entrepreneurs and considers moderating factors by decomposing shares of foreign-born population by origin (within and outside of the EU) and by education level. Combining survey data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor with population-based indicators of cultural diversity, we carry out a multilevel analysis for 140 European regions. The results suggest that entrepreneurs in culturally more diverse regions are significantly more likely to exhibit innovation orientation."
"Cultural diversity, social integration, and migrant entrepreneurship—evidence from the China migrants dynamic survey","Cultural diversity in host regions presents challenges for migrant entrepreneurs, such as resource competition and social conflicts. However, whether and how cultural diversity in the host regions affects migrants’ participation in entrepreneurship is not yet well understood. This study investigates the relationship by utilizing the China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) database and introducing food diversity as a novel proxy for cultural diversity. The logit regression analysis reveals that cultural diversity in host regions can reduce migrant engagement in entrepreneurial activities, especially in “self-employed” entrepreneurship. The results are consistent with several robustness tests. Additionally, a mechanism analysis based on a multi-path mediation model reveals that social integration, including factors such as social interaction, social exclusion, and social identification, plays a mediating role in this relationship. However, robust institutional environments can moderate the negative impact of cultural diversity on migrant entrepreneurship. This study provides a fresh non-market perspective for understanding and promoting cross-cultural entrepreneurial behavior."
“People Gathered by Sorghum”: Cultural Practices and sorghum Diversity in Northern Ethiopia,"Sorghum is an important crop in the livelihoods of Kunama and Tigrayan farmers in Northern Ethiopia and we present here a study of what factors have shaped the genetic diversity of the varieties cultivated in neighboring communities of the two ethnolinguistic groups. Using a combination of methods from crop science and cultural anthropology, we investigate patterns of historical and contemporary relationships between crop genetic diversity and cultural and social factors. The spatial genetic structure reveals patterns of ethnolinguistic differentiation and admixture that reflect deep affinities between cultures and crops, but the seed systems of the two communities are also open to exchange and gene-flow. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding cultural factors for genetic resource conservation, as well as for plant breeding and seed system development efforts."
How business groups build globally relevant knowledge from local contexts? Exploring the double-edged sword effect of cultural diversity,"In this study, we theorize and empirically explore whether and how locally relevant learning contributes to the enhancement of globally relevant learning. We also examine the conditions under which specific types of such locally relevant learning contribute to globally relevant learning in group-affiliated firms in an emerging economy. Using firm-level survey data from India, we explicitly model and test the hypotheses based on our questions. Results suggest positive and significant contributions of home- and host-based locally relevant learning of group-affiliated firms in improving their global learning capabilities. Interestingly, evidence shows an inverse U-shaped moderating effect of dynamic cultural diversity, indicating that the effects of home- and host-based locally relevant learning on globally relevant learning are the highest when dynamic cultural diversity is moderate. The effects are lower when cultural diversity is low or high."
Wearing the Same Jersey? The Impact of Players’ Cultural Diversity and Shared Team Tenure on National Soccer Team Performance,"In the present paper, we empirically analyze a dataset from national soccer teams between 2004 and 2019 to investigate the impact of team members’ cultural diversity on final team outcomes. Further, we examine the role of shared team tenure as a proxy of tacit knowledge and within team communications in relation to the cultural diversity–team performance relationship. After addressing a potential endogeneity issue, results from multiple instrumental variable estimation methods implied a higher level of cultural diversity enhanced on-field performance. Meanwhile, increased level of shared team tenure further strengthened the effect associated with cultural diversity on team performance."
The Cost and Benefit of Regional Cultural Diversity on the Income of Rural Workers: Evidence from China,"This paper studies the impact of regional cultural diversity of working cities on the income of rural workers. Using a nationally representative micro-dataset in China, and adopting dialect diversity at the city level as the indicator of regional cultural diversity, we find that regional cultural diversity has a highly significant hump-shaped effect on rural workers' incomes from the wage employment and self-employment, reflecting a trade-off between the beneficial and the detrimental effects of regional cultural diversity on rural workers' incomes. The results remain robust to the inclusion of a set of covariates, alternative estimation technique, alternative measure of regional cultural diversity, and a placebo test. We also find that the detrimental effect of diversity is weaker for high-educated rural workers, and the impact of regional cultural diversity remains stable in the short term. To address potential endogeneity, we employ an instrumental variable approach by using the river length of cities to instrument the dialect diversity, and the instrumented results confirm the conclusions. In addition, we provide empirical evidence that the cost and benefit of regional cultural diversity on the income of rural workers can be attributed to reduced social capital and increased creativity."
Cultural diversity in unequal societies sustained through cross-cultural competence and identity valuation,"In much contemporary political discourse, valued cultural characteristics are threatened by interaction with culturally distinct others, such as immigrants or a hegemonic majority. Such interaction often fosters cross-cultural competence (CCC), the ability to interact successfully across cultural boundaries. However, most theories of cultural dynamics ignore CCC, making cultural diversity incompatible with mutually beneficial inter-group interaction, and contributing to fears of cultural loss. Here, interview-based field methods at an Amazonian ethnic boundary demonstrate the prevalence of CCC. These data motivate a new theoretical mathematical model, incorporating competing developmental paths to CCC and group identity valuation, that illuminates how a common strategy of disempowered minorities can counter-intuitively sustain cultural diversity within a single generation: Given strong group identity, minorities in a structurally unequal, integrative society can maintain their distinctive cultural norms by learning those of the majority. Furthermore, rather than a rejection of, or threat to, majority culture, the valuation of a distinctive minority identity can characterize CCC individuals committed to extensive, mutually beneficial engagement with the majority as members of an integrative, multi-cultural society."
