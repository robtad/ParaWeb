Peer relationship increasing the risk of social media addiction among Chinese adolescents who have negative emotions,"The proliferation of social media has revolutionized the dynamics of interpersonal interaction, but concurrently, it poses the threat of excessive usage. This investigation examined the psychometric properties of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale and probed the mediating influence of peer relationships on the link between adverse emotional states and the propensity for social media addiction. A total of 1258 online survey respondents completed a battery of scales, which were subsequently analyzed using exploratory structural equation modeling. The results revealed a robust one-factor structure for the BSMAS, accompanied by satisfactory internal consistency. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between negative emotions and the risk of social media addiction, with both negative emotions and peer relationships emerging as significant predictors of this risk. Notably, peer relationships were found to exert a positive moderating effect on the relationship between negative emotions and social media addiction, whereas gender did not exhibit a moderating influence. The BSMAS was thus validated as a reliable instrument for assessing social media addiction among Chinese adolescents, with peer relationships playing a crucial role in mitigating the impact of negative emotions on social media addiction."
A novel machine learning and face recognition technique for fake accounts detection system on cyber social networks,"The proliferation of Online Social Networks (OSNs) like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others has been remarkable in recent years, offering users a platform to reconnect with family and friends, expand their social circles, and engage in various online activities. While these platforms provide a multitude of benefits, they also pose significant concerns regarding privacy and security. This paper identifies the threats associated with OSNs and proposes a novel digital face-processing authentication method, which involves a two-factor verification process utilizing Matlab. By leveraging deep learning classification and training the model with a real dataset from a live webcam, we achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 95%. However, the widespread adoption of such methods across all social networks remains a challenge, particularly in light of the pervasive issue of fake accounts, which are often exploited to launch spam campaigns, spread malware, and execute phishing attacks. These fraudulent accounts can result in substantial financial losses, reputational damage, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. This study focuses on distinguishing between genuine and fake profiles on OSNs, utilizing two datasets from Facebook and Instagram that comprise diverse features. By applying machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, among others, we found that SVM achieved the highest classification accuracy of 97.1% in detecting fake profiles."
Linking health impact and Post-environmental impact assessments: a case of municipal sewage treatment plant volatile organic compounds,"""Despite ongoing limitations in health impact assessments (HIAs) and environmental impact assessments (EIAs), a novel approach was developed to bridge the theoretical gaps in EIA by investigating the case of a municipal sewage treatment plant's (MSTP) odor emissions. By leveraging geographic factors, the study correlated the spatial dispersion of pollutants with human activities based on land-use characteristics. Following a thorough screening of priority pollutants, odors, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia were identified as key targets. Subsequently, spatial parameters were surveyed, encompassing meteorological analysis, environmental emission monitoring, and emission source analysis, to predict pollutant diffusion patterns. Land-use attributes were categorized to reflect various human social activities and exposure patterns. By integrating pollutant dispersion with exposure profiles using spatial coordination factors, the study successfully linked the spatial distribution of pollutants with the scenario population's activities. Building upon conventional HIA risk calculation methods, this research introduced spatial techniques to enhance the approach. The resulting HIA contour maps provide a geographic framework for determining acceptable levels of MSTP odor pollutants, thereby addressing the shortcomings of HIA in EIA applications and offering a significant step towards integrating HIA with post-EIA via spatial factors."""

Decentralization System Using Smart Blockchain with Secure Hash,"Here is a paraphrased version of the original text, exhibiting both syntactic and lexical diversity while preserving semantic similarity:

""The concept of blockchain decentralization revolves around the redistribution of authority and data governance. This paradigm shift transforms a centralized network into a distributed one, where decision-making power is relinquished from a single entity, be it an individual, organization, or group. By doing so, the decentralized system minimizes the need for mutual trust among users, instead relying on the inherent functionality of the network to prevent degradation. This, in turn, enables the utilization of smart contracts to regulate and control the decentralized system. This paper proposes a novel blockchain decentralization framework, dubbed 'smart blockchain' or 'smart chain,' which leverages smart contracts generated by blocks to facilitate accurate and seamless data collection. The decentralized nature of smart blockchain ensures that there is no single point of vulnerability, rendering it impervious to tampering, hacking, and other malicious activities. Concurrently, this decentralization approach enables the secure storage and registration of data in new blocks, with transactions being executed automatically, sans human intervention. The smart blockchain technology has the potential to supplant traditional blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, and overcome the limitations of smart contract deployment and registration. Our research focuses on four key processes: new_block, new_transaction, last_block, and hash, which are facilitated through the Flask framework and communicated via HTTP Protocol. The assessment of this decentralized system, enabled by smart blockchain, is poised to revolutionize application research, including IoT-powered Smart Homes. Furthermore, our evaluation of smart blockchain technology examines its security, complexity, privacy, integrity, and implementation protocols, demonstrating its superior performance across multiple blockchain blocks."""

The Mediating Effect of Self-Efficacy in the Relationship Between Parental Communication and Digital Addiction,"Over the past few years, the rampant utilization of digital technologies has precipitated the onset of digital dependency at increasingly younger ages. Despite this, research elucidating the underlying causes of digital dependency remains scarce. The present investigation aimed to explore the correlations between maternal and paternal communication patterns, digital dependency, and the potential mediating role of self-efficacy, as well as the moderating influence of gender. A sample of 601 middle school students (61.7% female, mean age 12.23, SD 1.03) completed a battery of assessments, including the Digital Addiction Scale for Children, Adolescent Family Process Measure, General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Demographic Questionnaire. Structural equation modeling was employed to test the study's hypotheses. The results revealed that paternal communication exhibited a direct association with self-efficacy, which, in turn, was indirectly linked to digital dependency. In contrast, maternal communication was found to have a direct, yet distinct, relationship with digital dependency. Notably, gender moderation tests yielded significant results, with the indirect effect of maternal communication on digital dependency emerging as significant only among female participants. These findings suggest that initiatives aimed at enhancing parental communication and fostering self-efficacy in children may be instrumental in mitigating digital dependency, while also providing valuable insights for mental health professionals seeking to understand the complex interplay between parent-child communication and digital dependency in young people."
Face-to-face more important than digital communication for mental health during the pandemic,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic's restrictive periods, individuals sought to offset the dearth of in-person connections by ramping up their online interactions. However, a four-week daily diary study involving 411 participants from German-speaking regions, who completed 9791 questionnaires, revealed that digital communication played a relatively minor role in maintaining lockdown-era mental wellbeing compared to face-to-face exchanges. Notably, digital text-based interactions, such as emailing, WhatsApp messaging, and texting, exhibited a significant correlation with mental health outcomes, while both face-to-face and digital text-based communication proved more influential in predicting mental health than physical activity or outdoor pursuits. The findings emphasize the paramount importance of in-person connections for mental health, and also indicate that videoconferencing, despite offering enhanced visual and auditory cues, had a negligible impact on mental wellbeing."
Emoji as gesture in digital communication: Emoji improve comprehension of indirect speech,"As digital communication becomes increasingly prevalent, the ability to convey meaning effectively through written language takes on greater significance. However, the shift to text-based communication also means that the benefits of nonverbal cues, such as hand gestures, are lost. These gestures play a crucial role in facilitating understanding and clarifying the nuances of spoken language by providing visual context. The question arises as to whether emojis, which are used to augment text-based communication, can serve a similar purpose. This study investigates whether emojis can enhance the comprehension of indirect speech, which relies heavily on contextual cues, such as hand gestures, to convey meaning. Building on previous research, we adapted gesture-based experiments to a digital, text-based format, substituting emojis for gestures. Participants were presented with 12 hypothetical text-message exchanges featuring indirect speech, conveyed through text alone, text with emojis, or emojis alone. The results showed that emojis improved comprehension, with participants more accurately interpreting indirect speech in the emoji-only condition, followed by the text-with-emoji condition, and then the text-only condition. These findings suggest that emojis are not merely decorative, but rather an integral component of text-based communication, serving to disambiguate complex messages and facilitate understanding, much like gestures do in face-to-face interactions."

Humans versus AI: whether and why we prefer human-created compared to AI-created artwork,"The rapid emergence of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) models that can replicate human artistic masterpieces has sparked debate about whether AI-generated creations will eventually supplant human innovations, although some doubters contend that this scenario is improbable. A potential explanation for this skepticism lies in the fact that, beyond the physical attributes of art, we assign significant importance to the infusion of human sentiment and experience in artistic expressions. This raises an intriguing question: do people exhibit a preference for human-generated versus AI-created artworks, and if so, why? To investigate this, we conducted an experiment where we randomly attributed ""Human-created"" or ""AI-created"" labels to AI-generated paintings and evaluated participants' assessments of the artworks across four dimensions (Aesthetic Appeal, Visual Attractiveness, Depth, and Monetary Value). The results of Study 1 revealed that human-labelled art received more favorable evaluations across all dimensions. Study 2 aimed to replicate and expand upon Study 1 by incorporating additional ratings (Emotional Resonance, Narrative, Significance, Creative Effort, and Time Invested) to elucidate the underlying reasons for the preference towards human-labelled artworks. The primary findings of Study 1 were replicated, with narrative richness and perceived creative effort influencing the label effects (""Human-created"" vs. ""AI-created"") solely for the sensory-level evaluations (Aesthetic Appeal, Visual Attractiveness). Furthermore, positive attitudes towards AI moderated label effects for more abstract judgements (Depth, Monetary Value). These studies demonstrate that people tend to harbor a negative bias against AI-generated artworks compared to those perceived as human-created, suggesting that awareness of human involvement in the creative process positively impacts art appreciation."

Framing Effects on Support for Universal Basic Income in the US,"A universal basic income has been touted as a solution to the societal ills spawned by technological progress and entrenched inequality, but it faces stiff resistance from conservatives in Europe and the US, according to recent findings. However, could reframing this welfare initiative in a way that resonates with conservative values such as personal autonomy and minimal government intervention help sway their opinion? To investigate, I devised a novel survey experiment that randomly presented participants with one of two distinct narratives: either a ""fair-start"" narrative emphasizing UBI's role in fostering a merit-based society and encouraging individual initiative, or a ""small-government"" narrative highlighting UBI's potential to curb bureaucratic excess and limit state intervention. Despite these efforts, American conservatives – identified through their responses to 10 policy statements – remained resolute in their opposition to UBI. Furthermore, an analysis of their open-ended responses revealed that their justifications for rejecting UBI remained unchanged, regardless of the framing used. The results suggest that conservatives' antipathy towards UBI is deeply ingrained, even when its core components are repackaged to align with their ideological leanings, and offer insights into the challenges of reframing UBI in a politically palatable way."
Are ‘red wall’ constituencies really opposed to progressive policy? Examining the impact of materialist narratives for Universal Basic Income,"While Universal Basic Income is frequently touted as an attractive concept in principle, its electoral viability is often doubted. Lawmakers assume that socially conservative constituents, who would actually gain financially from the policy, would instinctively resist it due to perceived unfairness. However, our research in Wales and the Midlands and North of England reveals that this assumption is misguided. We discovered significant backing for UBI, with varying narrative approaches resonating with different groups based on their practical needs. Furthermore, our innovative 'adversarial collaboration' approach demonstrated that straightforward, benefits-focused narratives can dramatically boost support even among initial skeptics. By emphasizing tangible advantages, these narratives proved more persuasive than appeals to abstract principles, suggesting that policymakers should be wary of overemphasizing 'values'-based explanations for public opinion."
"Robots, labor markets, and universal basic income","""In contemporary societies, the far-reaching consequences of automation on various socioeconomic aspects, including income, employment, and productivity, have sparked significant concern. Whereas prior research has primarily focused on the implications of automation on job security and remuneration, our investigation seeks to elucidate the impact of automation on productivity and how policy interventions, such as robot taxation or universal basic income, influence this relationship. To achieve this, we designed an experiment in which workers make decisions about their productive effort, while managers choose between human labor and robotic alternatives. Our baseline scenario assesses the effort exerted by workers facing potential robot replacement, as well as firms' substitution decisions. Subsequent treatments introduce a universal basic income equivalent to one-fifth of the median wage or a tax on firms that replace workers with robots. We also examine the coexistence of workers and robots in part-time employment arrangements. Our findings indicate that the threat of robot substitution does not influence workers' effort levels. Furthermore, neither universal basic income nor robot taxation leads to decreased worker effort. However, the robot substitution tax reduces the likelihood of worker replacement. Notably, workers who benefit from managers' decisions to retain them over more productive robots do not exhibit increased effort. Our conclusions provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between policy and worker behavior in an era of pervasive automation."""
A global conservation basic income to safeguard biodiversity,"""Fostering a sustainable future through biodiversity conservation demands an approach that is all-encompassing, fair, and respectful of diverse perspectives. The concept of a conservation basic income (CBI), which involves providing unconditional financial support to individuals living in crucial conservation zones, has the potential to drive a profound paradigm shift in conservation efforts. This study presents a thorough examination of the projected annual expenditures for a global CBI initiative, exploring three plausible future conservation scenarios through spatial analysis. The estimated costs vary significantly, ranging from $351 billion to $6.73 trillion, depending on the areas and populations targeted. Implementing a $5.50 daily CBI in existing protected areas within low- and middle-income countries would require an annual investment of $478 billion. While these figures are substantial compared to current government conservation expenditures (approximately $133 billion in 2020), they represent a potentially wise investment in preserving invaluable social and natural assets, as well as the estimated $44 trillion in global economic output reliant on natural resources."""

Alien Fish Species in Cooling Ponds of Nuclear Power Plants and State District Power Stations of Central Russia,"This paper provides a comprehensive review of non-native fish populations thriving in the cooling systems of nuclear power plants and district power stations across Central Russia, highlighting the unique characteristics of the recipient water bodies that support these thermophilic species, which are foreign to the region's indigenous fish fauna. The study delves into the history of their introduction, biological distinctiveness, catch rates, and fisheries importance in six specially managed reservoirs spanning the Moscow, Smolensk, Ryazan, and Kursk regions. The primary pathways of hydrobiont invasions in these cooling systems are identified for each non-native species, based on ichthyological monitoring data. Furthermore, the paper predicts the future trajectory of alien fish species populations in response to shifts in reservoir thermal regimes, stocking volumes, and fishing intensities in Central Russia's nuclear and district power plants."
Erosion and Corrosion of Pipelines and Equipment on the Power Uprate of Power Units at Nuclear Power Plants (NPP),"The modern nuclear industry's evolution is marked by the upscaling of operational power units to surpass their current rated thermal capacity, thereby boosting electricity generation and reducing costs. This process, known as power uprating, can be achieved by augmenting the reactor's thermal output and optimizing the turbine's efficiency. Globally, including in Russia, nuclear power plants (NPPs) typically undergo a 2-20% thermal power increase above their nominal level, with the United States and Europe being at the forefront of this trend. However, such upgrades may necessitate the retrofitting of turbines, condensers, generators, and other equipment. The resulting altered operating conditions of power unit equipment and pipelines, including changes in temperature, pressure, and steam humidity, can accelerate the erosion-corrosion rate of metal surfaces in the process circuit, ultimately reducing their residual lifespan. Foreign experts' computational simulations have shown that the erosion-corrosion rate of specific pipelines and equipment can surge by over 50% following a power uprate. Consequently, obtaining a license for an NPP power uprate in the United States requires computational assessments using specialized software to identify vulnerable equipment and pipelines. Since 2009, Russia's nuclear power plants have employed the RAMEK software code to predict erosion-corrosion rates in pipeline and equipment elements. In practice, power uprating can also exacerbate cavitation and droplet impact erosion in elements with complex geometries, highlighting the need for comprehensive computational and experimental studies to evaluate the impact of altered operating conditions on erosion-corrosion wear patterns in pipeline elements and equipment."

Intelligent planning of controllers for improved resilience in multi-area system involving nuclear power,"The escalating quest for novel energy harvesting methods from diverse sources to satiate the burgeoning consumer demand has precipitated a plethora of complexities in stabilizing the power grid amidst disparate disruptions. To mitigate these hurdles, this research paper pioneers an innovative paradigm that synergistically integrates a controller with the soft computing methodology of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The investigation focuses on a quad-unit power system, wherein three disparate energy sources are harnessed and distributed across two distinct zones. Each zone boasts two power sources, with one zone featuring a hybrid thermal and gas power plant configuration, and the other comprising a nuclear power plant and a gas power plant. The transmission of power from the nuclear facility is particularly intricate due to its heightened susceptibility to perturbations, necessitating an intelligent and efficient controller to ensure robust governance in this nuclear-integrated power network. Furthermore, the paper undertakes an exhaustive examination of the noxious emissions associated with electricity generation from the various power plants under consideration, with the ultimate objective of minimizing the carbon footprint attendant to power generation. The proposed framework and analysis are actualized within the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment."
Fire simulation in the main control room of Bushehr nuclear power plant using CFAST software,"Ensuring the safety and mitigating the risks of nuclear power plants is crucial, and fire protection is a paramount concern in this regard. The main control room, a critical area prone to fire hazards, is a focal point in safety evaluations of nuclear facilities. Despite the existence of reliable shutdown protocols for commercial reactors in the event of a fire, this study aims to simulate a fire scenario in the main control room of Bushehr nuclear power plant unit-1 using the CFAST software, a two-zone fire modeling tool that predicts the spread of smoke, fire gases, and temperature within a building's compartments during a fire. The necessary data for the simulation were gleaned from the final safety analysis reports, operating documents of BNPP-1, and NUREG6850 reports. The simulation results revealed that the upper section of the standing cabinet reached a scorching temperature of approximately 1013°C, attributed to the combined effects of flames and heat transfer via smoke, while the lower section recorded a temperature of around 700°C. Furthermore, the first ventilation system remained shut for approximately 350 seconds, and the second ventilation system was closed for around 860 seconds after the fire broke out."

Ultimately, interdisciplinary collaboration is poised to become the hallmark of future research, particularly in addressing complex, large-scale societal and global challenges."
The Organizational Underpinnings of Social Justice Theory Development,"""During a seminal era, social psychology was deeply rooted in the concept of justice, yielding influential theories that have resonated across disciplines tackling societal, political, and economic challenges. However, subsequent paradigm shifts within psychology have led to the peripheralization of social justice scholars, stifling innovation in theoretical frameworks. This study proposes institutional reforms to foster a new wave of researchers dedicated to social justice theory, a pressing imperative given the escalating prevalence and gravity of justice-related issues globally."""
Basic social justice orientations—measuring order-related justice in the European Social Survey Round 9,"People harbor conceptions of fairness regarding the allocation of resources and responsibilities within a collective entity, which influence their assessment of existing disparities and are rooted in four fundamental tenets. Firstly, the principle of egalitarianism advocates for uniform distribution of benefits and burdens. In contrast, the need principle considers individual inputs, while the merit-based principle of equity proposes allocation based on deservingness. Lastly, the entitlement principle suggests that distribution should be determined by inherent characteristics, such as gender, and acquired status, like occupational prestige. Previous studies have shown that preferences for these principles vary depending on social standing and societal structure. The Basic Social Justice Orientations scale was designed to measure adherence to these principles, but its application has been limited to Germany. The inclusion of four scale items, each representing a principle, in the 9th round of the European Social Survey provides a unique opportunity to examine both intra- and inter-country differences. This report presents evidence on the measurement quality of these items in 29 European countries, analyzing response patterns, non-response rates, reliability, and correlations with related variables. The findings indicate that the scale items exhibit low non-response rates, reliably estimate agreement with the principles, and display expected correlations with related concepts. However, researchers should be aware that the scale, as implemented, only provides surface-level indicators, which may not capture the full range of the underlying principles but rather focus on specific aspects."
A systematic review and meta-analysis of procedural justice and legitimacy in policing: the effect of social identity and social contexts,"""This study aimed to investigate the interplay between social identity, social environments, and the relationship between fair policing procedures and public trust in law enforcement. A comprehensive meta-analysis of 123 studies involving over 200,000 participants was conducted, employing advanced statistical models to examine the correlations. The findings revealed that both fair procedures and social identity have a significant impact on police legitimacy, with social identity playing a mediating role in this association. Notably, the strength of this correlation varied across different age groups and countries, with younger individuals and those from more developed nations exhibiting a stronger link. The study's conclusions underscore the critical role of social identity in shaping public perceptions of police legitimacy and highlight the need to consider the diverse social contexts in which policing takes place."""
Teachers’ Social Emotional Learning Competencies and Social Justice Teaching Beliefs and Associations with Children’s Prosocial Behavior and Community Engagement,"""In out-of-school settings, high-quality interactions with program staff can cultivate individual and collective prosocial abilities. This study investigated whether the social-emotional skills of STEM teachers, who incorporated social-emotional learning into their curriculum, influenced students' prosocial behavior, community involvement, and peer relationships, and whether these effects were influenced by teachers' social justice beliefs and the gender of the students. The sample consisted of 126 students (72 boys) from diverse racial backgrounds, primarily in the third grade (average age: 8.11 years). Teachers evaluated their own emotional intelligence, commitment to social-emotional learning, and social justice teaching beliefs, as well as their students' prosocial behavior and peer relationships. Students also assessed their own community engagement. The findings revealed that teachers' emotional intelligence was negatively linked to prosocial behavior when their social justice beliefs were weak, but positively associated with community engagement. In contrast, teachers' commitment to social-emotional learning was positively correlated with prosocial behavior. Furthermore, teachers' emotional intelligence was linked to peer problems, but only among girls. These results highlight the significance of STEM teachers' social-emotional learning competencies and social justice beliefs in fostering students' prosocial abilities and community engagement, and provide avenues for future research."""
Learning to Lead for Equity and Social Justice through Critical Reflection and Autobiography,"This study leverages autobiographical storytelling and critical introspection as an instructional strategy within an educational leadership preparation program, empowering prospective school administrators to scrutinize their beliefs and presuppositions regarding equity and social justice. The emerging themes, which illuminate the evolution of their social justice and equity perspectives, encompass: (a) recognizing the interplay between personal heritage, lived experience, and systemic injustices, (b) cultivating self-awareness of one's positionality as a catalyst for informed leadership, and (c) translating vision into action through deliberate praxis. By integrating pedagogical approaches that facilitate candid self-reflection and engagement with the world, this method has the potential to enable students to reinterpret their past, reframe their current aspirations, and amplify their capacity to drive positive change as agents of justice."
Focusing on the “Social” in Social Justice Research,"I highlight the existence of a profound correlation between individuals' perceptions of fairness and their responses that demonstrate investment in social networks and interpersonal bonds. A concise examination of research on perceived fairness and the fair process effects reveals the deeply social nature of reactions to fair or unfair treatment, namely, how fairness perceptions significantly influence individuals' sense of belonging and security within the social context in which the treatment occurs. This well-documented link between fairness and group involvement prompts intriguing inquiries about the impact of perceived fairness on classic group dynamics phenomena. I explore potential research avenues related to fairness and social identity formation, fairness and deference to authority, and fairness and compliance with norms, arguing that investigating these questions would provide a more solid grounding in the fundamental social psychology of fairness and revitalize the group dynamics aspect of social psychology as a field of study."
AI ethics and ordoliberalism 2.0: towards a ‘Digital Bill of Rights’,"This study examines the ethics of artificial intelligence through the lens of a unique business ethics framework, namely, 'ordoliberalism 2.0.' It contends that the current conversation surrounding AI, including generative AI, is overly reliant on self-policing by corporations and voluntary codes of conduct, resulting in inadequate governance structures. To rectify this, the paper proposes the introduction of stringent legislation with enhanced oversight mechanisms, as well as the integration of existing AI guidelines with an ordoliberal-influenced regulatory and competition policy. Notably, the connection between AI ethics, regulation, and antitrust policy remains underexplored in both academic and non-academic circles. This paper fills a significant knowledge gap in the literature, contributing to the predominantly legal, political, and philosophical discussions on AI governance. The research objectives are twofold: firstly, to establish ordoliberal-inspired AI ethics principles that could form the basis of a 'digital bill of rights,' and secondly, to demonstrate how these principles can be implemented on a large scale through ordoliberal competition and regulatory policies."
From AI Ethics Principles to Practices: A Teleological Methodology to Apply AI Ethics Principles in The Defence Domain,"This paper outlines a framework for operationalizing AI ethics guidelines to establish clear benchmarks for the creation and implementation of artificial intelligence in high-stakes environments. The approach involves a tripartite process, overseen by a diverse, autonomous ethics committee, which: (1) determines the optimal level of granularity for mapping the AI development cycle; (2) distills core principles into actionable directives for each lifecycle stage; and (3) establishes guidelines for balancing competing principles in context-dependent scenarios. The proposed framework is intentionally flexible, scalable, and repeatable, and when integrated into an organization's ethical DNA, it facilitates the responsible design, development, and deployment of AI solutions, as exemplified by its application to the UK Ministry of Defence's AI ethics framework."
Reflections on Putting AI Ethics into Practice: How Three AI Ethics Approaches Conceptualize Theory and Practice,"Present-day detractors contend that artificial intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks rooted in applied ethics are overly reliant on abstract principles, resulting in a disconnect between theoretical foundations and practical applications. To bridge this gap, various approaches attempt to operationalize ethical theories into tangible practices. This article delves into the ways in which prominent AI ethics frameworks – namely, embedded ethics, ethically aligned design, and Value Sensitive Design – translate ethical principles into actionable strategies. Through a critical examination of each approach, we identify their conceptual strengths and weaknesses: embedded ethics risks contextual bias, ethically aligned design lacks theoretical justification for resolving principle-based conflicts, and Value Sensitive Design requires integration with governance structures. Building upon these findings, we propose a meta-framework for applied AI ethics, comprising three key dimensions informed by critical theory. This framework encourages critical reflection on the interplay between theory and practice, highlighting the importance of incorporating affective and emotional considerations to address vulnerabilities and marginalization. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for normative background theories to provide evaluative criteria and guidance for navigating conflicting principles. Finally, the framework underscores the significance of governance structures in revealing power dynamics and ensuring the ethical development and deployment of AI systems."
A semi-automated software model to support AI ethics compliance assessment of an AI system guided by ethical principles of AI,"The adherence to fundamental tenets and directives governing the ethical development of artificial intelligence (AI) has a profound influence on organizations involved in creating AI systems. Ethics, a multifaceted and dynamic concept, undergoes continuous transformation across cultural, geographical, and temporal boundaries. A diverse range of stakeholders, including international organizations, nation-states, and private entities, strive to delineate the ethical paradigm for AI. Consequently, numerous regulatory bodies have issued decrees and guidelines pertaining to AI ethics. The development of AI systems that conform to ethical frameworks poses a formidable challenge for companies, and the repercussions of non-compliance can be severe, rendering adherence to these requirements a paramount concern. Moreover, a dearth of technical instruments exists to ensure AI systems conform to ethical standards. The scarcity of ethics auditing tools for AI, coupled with the prevailing emphasis on establishing ethical guidelines for AI development, has prompted us to propose a semi-automated software model for verifying the ethical compliance of AI system code. To actualize this model, we prioritize the following crucial aspects: (1) a comprehensive examination of existing ethical compliance systems through literature review, (2) an analysis of international and European perspectives on AI ethics, (3) the identification of universally accepted AI principles and sub-principles, and (4) the design of a semi-automated software for verifying AI systems' ethical compliance during both the design phase and post-development, adopting an ethics-by-design approach."
Towards AI ethics’ institutionalization: knowledge bridges from business ethics to advance organizational AI ethics,"This study advocates for fostering a deeper understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics by leveraging the expertise of adjacent fields, notably business ethics, with a focus on the pivotal role of organizational frameworks and institutionalization processes. As AI systems have experienced exponential growth in recent years, a vibrant discussion on AI ethics has re-emerged, primarily centered around ethical principles, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications. We contend that the wealth of knowledge accumulated in business ethics can have a positive ripple effect on AI ethics, given the widespread adoption of voluntary and mandatory guidelines for corporate social responsibility across national and international jurisdictions. Specifically, business ethics can offer valuable insights to AI ethics in five key areas: (1) managing stakeholder expectations, (2) standardized disclosure practices, (3) governance and regulatory frameworks, (4) curriculum development and accreditation, and (5) the phenomenon of AI ethics posturing, analogous to greenwashing. By elaborating on these five knowledge transfer pathways, we highlight the current challenges in AI ethics and the potential contributions of business ethics to the ongoing discourse. Moreover, we believe that business ethics can also learn from AI ethics in navigating the complexities of digitalization, thereby facilitating a cross-pollination of ideas between the two fields. Ultimately, future discussions in both applied ethics disciplines can benefit from reciprocal exchange and cross-fertilization, aimed at enriching ethical understanding and preventing superficial or even hostile approaches to ethics."
Unveiling public perception of AI ethics: an exploration on Wikipedia data,"""As AI technologies increasingly interact with humans, they have unveiled a multitude of ethical concerns. However, the general public often remains oblivious to these issues, and the lack of awareness hinders efforts to address them. Previous research has probed public sentiments and opinions on AI ethics through surveys and social media, but these studies have primarily focused on categorizing popular themes and emotions, neglecting the underlying knowledge gaps. Few investigations have delved into the comprehensive knowledge framework of AI ethics and the relationships between subtopics. Leveraging Wikipedia's collaborative knowledge-sharing platform, this study seeks to understand how the public grasps the complex body of knowledge surrounding AI ethics. By employing community detection methods, we identified a hierarchical network of AI ethical topics and extracted relevant entities, including proper nouns, organizations, and individuals. Our findings indicate that the core topics at the highest level of the community, most closely tied to AI ethics, predominantly center around knowledge-centric and ethical concerns, such as shifts from Information Theory to Internet Copyright Infringement. Ultimately, this study makes three key contributions: (1) mapping the comprehensive knowledge structure of AI ethics, (2) assessing and refining the existing body of knowledge on AI ethics, and (3) enhancing public understanding of AI ethics to mitigate the risks associated with AI technologies."""
How to design an AI ethics board,"""The integration and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems entails substantial perils to societal well-being. To mitigate these threats to a tolerable threshold, AI corporations require a robust risk mitigation framework and prudent governance structures. This study examines a specific strategy for enhancing risk governance in AI companies: the establishment of an AI ethics committee. We delineate five pivotal design considerations: (1) What authority should the committee wield? (2) What legal framework should it operate within? (3) Who should comprise the committee's membership? (4) How should it arrive at decisions? (5) And what resources are necessary for its functioning? We deconstruct each of these inquiries into more nuanced sub-inquiries, catalog potential options, and analyze how disparate design decisions influence the committee's capacity to alleviate societal perils associated with AI. The history of failed attempts underscores the complexity of designing an AI ethics committee. This paper offers a comprehensive guide to aid AI corporations in surmounting these obstacles."""
Embedding responsibility in intelligent systems: from AI ethics to responsible AI ecosystems,"Autonomous intelligent systems, which can make decisions based on environmental inputs, hold immense promise for positive impact, yet they also spark substantial social and ethical apprehensions. While the ongoing debate surrounding AI ethics has exhaustively explored these concerns and proposed various solutions, a notable oversight is its focus on isolated issues and mitigation strategies, neglecting the intrinsic nature of intelligent systems as complex, interconnected socio-technical ecosystems. This article contends that a crucial step forward would be to define the parameters of responsible AI ecosystems, introducing the concept of meta-responsibility to outline the essential characteristics of such ecosystems. This novel perspective not only enriches the theoretical landscape of AI ethics but also provides a valuable framework for researchers and developers of intelligent systems to re-examine their approach to ethical considerations."
The ethics of AI business practices: a review of 47 AI ethics guidelines,"A plethora of AI ethics frameworks have emerged recently, prioritizing the virtues of fairness, accountability, sustainability, and transparency in algorithm-driven decision-making processes. However, a notable scarcity of guidelines exists that scrutinize the ethical implications of the commercial and political ecosystems in which AI systems operate. This study presents the outcomes of a comprehensive literature review and thematic analysis, which aimed to assess the degree to which AI business ethics are addressed in a substantial corpus of guidelines. The findings indicate that the political and economic repercussions of AI-driven commercial practices are significantly marginalized in AI ethics frameworks. Currently, AI ethics guidelines exhibit a disproportionate emphasis on algorithmic decision-making, while the ethical integrity of the business environments in which AI systems are embedded remains severely compromised by cutthroat and speculative norms, moral posturing, corporate opacity, and other detrimental business practices."
Ethics in AI through the practitioner’s view: a grounded theory literature review,"The concept of ethics has become a pervasive theme in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven software systems, sparking intense scrutiny and debate. A surge in recent incidents has catapulted ethical concerns surrounding AI technology to the forefront of public consciousness, prompting questions about its integration into daily life. However, a crucial perspective remains largely unexplored: that of the AI developers themselves. To address this knowledge gap, we undertook a comprehensive grounded theory literature review of 38 empirical studies, distilling the views of AI practitioners on ethics into five core categories: awareness, perception, need, challenge, and approach. These categories are supported by a rich tapestry of codes and concepts, which we illustrate with evidence from the included studies. Our resulting taxonomy of AI ethics from a practitioner's vantage point provides a panoramic view of the critical aspects that AI developers grapple with when navigating ethical considerations. Additionally, we outline a roadmap for future research and offer actionable recommendations for practitioners, managers, and organisations seeking to better incorporate ethics into AI development."

This paper identifies the hurdles hindering the effective integration of AI ethics and underscores the barriers to achieving meaningful, real-world outcomes. A pilot case study is offered to catalyze the development of actionable AI ethics strategies, with the ultimate goal of sparking a discourse on rendering AI ethics operational and impactful in everyday applications."""
Mitochondrial gene editing,"""Alterations to the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome are the root cause of numerous debilitating diseases that currently lack effective treatments. The presence of multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome leads to a phenomenon known as heteroplasmy, where cells harbor both normal and mutated mtDNA. While normal mtDNA can functionally counterbalance the effects of mutated mtDNA until a critical threshold is exceeded, beyond which disease symptoms emerge. Despite the significant attention devoted to mitochondrial genetics, the double membrane surrounding mitochondria has long posed a significant obstacle to genetic modification. However, breakthroughs in the past twenty years have enabled the manipulation of mtDNA through the introduction of gene editing proteins that target specific DNA sequences. Mitochondria-targeted nucleases have been shown to selectively eliminate mutated mtDNA in cells and animal models exhibiting heteroplasmy. Furthermore, base editors have been adapted to induce precise C>T or A>G transitions in mtDNA. As a result, the long-awaited tools for modifying mtDNA have finally become a reality, holding immense promise for transforming the field of mitochondrial genetics. This Primer provides an in-depth exploration of mitochondrial gene editing, covering the selection of optimal gene editing tools, experimental design best practices, relevant analytical approaches, and the applications, limitations, and challenges associated with these technologies and the field as a whole."""
Gene Editing for the Treatment of Hypercholesterolemia,"This review aims to distill the essential discoveries from preclinical investigations that explored the notion that modifying hepatic gene expression can lead to a decrease in plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, thereby mitigating the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Notably, recent research has demonstrated that targeted delivery of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing tools to hepatocytes, achieved through encapsulation in N-acetylgalactosamine-coupled lipid nanoparticles, can induce a sustained 90% reduction in plasma proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels, accompanied by a 60% decrease in LDL-cholesterol levels in both murine and non-human primate models. Furthermore, studies in mice have shown that this cutting-edge technology can be expanded to encompass additional targets implicated in dyslipidemia, including angiopoietin-like 3 and various apolipoproteins. In summary, the application of gene editing technologies holds significant potential for reducing plasma LDL-cholesterol levels in humans, although ensuring the safety of gene editing is a crucial prerequisite for its clinical success."
Multiplexed gene editing in citrus by using a multi-intron containing Cas9 gene,"""A range of gene editing platforms have been engineered within the CRISPR/Cas9 framework, enabling the modification of disease-linked genes across a broad spectrum of citrus cultivars. This investigation introduces a novel strategy that leverages a Cas9 gene harboring multiple introns, accompanied by multiple guide RNAs interspersed with tRNA sequences, to target the phytoene desaturase gene in both 'Carrizo' citrange and 'Duncan' grapefruit. Remarkably, the utilization of this consolidated vector resulted in a substantial enhancement of editing efficacy in both citrus varieties, yielding mutations in all three designated targets. The deployment of this multiplex gene editing system, featuring a multi-intron-containing Cas9 and a gRNA-tRNA array, presents a promising route for efficient citrus genome modification, furnishing us with powerful tools in the ongoing struggle against diseases such as canker and huanglongbing."""
Gene editing and therapy in acquired and inherited cardiovascular disorders,"""Precision modification of the genetic underpinnings of cardiovascular diseases through gene editing and therapy offers unprecedented potential for tackling these debilitating conditions. By harnessing this technology, researchers can develop bespoke treatments that rectify inherited mutations responsible for disorders like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and familial hypercholesterolemia, as well as modulate gene expression in age-related and aberrant gene activity-driven conditions that currently lack effective interventions. Through targeted gene editing, the goal is to alleviate disease severity, enhance cardiac function, prevent recurrent episodes, and potentially extend healthy lifespan. Recent breakthroughs in gene therapy and editing for cardiovascular disorders have transformed treatment paradigms, offering new hope for individuals with genetic propensities to heart and vascular diseases and driving the quest for more tailored and efficacious therapies.

Simulation of dual-purpose chicken breeding programs implementing gene editing,"Despite the controversy and ethical dilemmas surrounding gene editing, its application is more palatable when it enhances animal welfare. A pressing concern in chicken breeding is the culling of male layer chicks due to their poor meat production capabilities, which could be addressed by developing dual-purpose chicken lines. However, unfavorable genetic correlations between egg and meat production traits hinder their viability. Gene editing, although ethically contentious, may expedite genetic progress in dual-purpose chickens and mitigate the ethical concerns associated with chick culling. A simulation was conducted to compare the utility improvement in dual-purpose use under two breeding schemes: enhancing laying hens and developing a synthetic line from a layer-broiler cross. The results showed that genetic gain could be accelerated by up to 81% over several generations with gene editing, depending on the number of edited single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per animal. However, the rate of genetic improvement equalized in scenarios with and without gene editing after 20 generations, as the remaining segregating QTL had minimal effects and their editing could have detrimental overall health consequences. Gene editing can improve genetic gain in quantitative traits, but its recommendation is contingent upon the presence of segregating QTL with significant effect sizes."

Enabling regulatory policy globally will promote realization of the potential of animal biotechnology,"The global food supply chain can be significantly enhanced through the application of animal biotechnologies, which hold great promise for bolstering sustainability and security. It is the duty of government regulatory bodies to guarantee the safety of food consumed by their citizens, regardless of whether it is produced using traditional breeding methods or cutting-edge biotechnologies. Although some nations have established guidelines for overseeing animal biotechnology, many others have yet to do so. Historically, regulatory clearance was required before biotechnology products could enter the market, but the exorbitant cost of this process limited the number and variety of animal and plant products seeking approval. To date, only one genetically engineered animal intended for human consumption has successfully navigated the approval process. The emergence of genome editing techniques has revolutionized the scientific approach to modifying DNA sequences, thereby transforming the potential of biotechnology in agricultural breeding. This shift has also prompted a reevaluation of regulatory discussions surrounding biotechnology. In response to these scientific breakthroughs, regulatory agencies are adapting their approaches, with an increasing number of countries seeking to modernize their regulatory frameworks based on risk assessment and similarity to conventionally bred organisms. Advances in animal biotechnology, particularly genome editing, can accelerate the integration of desirable traits in animals, such as improved yield, disease resistance, climate resilience, and enhanced animal welfare, as well as consumer-preferred food qualities. To facilitate the adoption of these biotechnology-enhanced animals in agricultural production and their entry into the consumer market, proportionate regulatory frameworks must be established, and international trade of animal products requires harmonized and compatible regulatory processes. Effective scientific communication with the public is essential for building trust in precision animal biotechnology and proportionate regulatory approaches. A 2022 international workshop on regulatory approaches to animal biotechnology, attended by 27 countries, provided a platform for discussing technical advancements, regulatory policy development, and strategies for engaging diverse publics on animal biotechnology. Our objective is to promote the development and implementation of proportionate regulatory approaches and policies globally."

A conceptual framework for automation disengagements,"Enhancing the reliability and performance of autonomous systems hinges on gaining a deeper insight into the circumstances surrounding automation disconnections. This investigation delves into the root causes of human-initiated and automation-triggered disconnections by examining the responses of 103 Tesla Autopilot and FSD Beta users through semi-structured interviews. The analysis yields a categorization of the factors contributing to disconnections, comprising five primary categories and 35 subcategories. These categories encompass the psychological and emotional states of human operators (5), their trust and perception of the automation (17), their awareness of other road users (3), the automation's assessment of human operators (3), and its limitations in navigating diverse environments (7). Human operators tend to disconnect the automation when they foresee potential failures, observe aberrant behavior, or doubt its ability to operate safely in challenging conditions. Adverse emotional states, such as frustration and distrust, also prompt human operators to disconnect the automation. Conversely, the automation disengages itself when it detects human operator inattention or speeding violations. Furthermore, human operators are influenced by the reactions of passengers and other road users, leading to disconnections due to perceived discomfort or embarrassment. The study's findings are distilled into a conceptual framework for understanding automation disconnections, drawing on human factors and control theory principles. This research provides valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of automation disconnections, highlighting both human concerns and social implications, and offers guidance on potential edge cases to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicle technology."

Disentropy in astronomy,"Astronomers frequently encounter stochasticity in their work, with celestial bodies and radio telescopes being prominent sources of uncertainty. Conversely, the random scattering of stars in certain astronomical images can hinder the performance of algorithms designed to automatically detect crucial features within those images. As a result, a stochasticity metric, such as the disentropy of the autocorrelation function, can serve as a valuable mathematical instrument for astronomers. In this study, we explore three novel applications of disentropy in astronomy. We begin by quantifying the stochasticity of cosmic microwave background maps generated by the Planck satellite, thereby providing a numerical estimate of this randomness for the first time. Next, we develop an algorithm that utilizes disentropy to eliminate regions of astronomical images exhibiting high stochasticity, which is particularly effective in removing background stars. In our third application, we employ disentropy to calculate the stochasticity of a radio pulsar's signal, which is used as a random number generator. Finally, we utilize relative disentropy as a distance metric between probability distributions to determine the parameters of a pulsar's flux density probability density function."

The results withstand the inclusion of control variables, alternative estimation methods, and alternative cultural diversity metrics, as well as a placebo test. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the adverse effects of diversity are mitigated for highly educated rural workers, and the impact of cultural diversity remains consistent in the short term. To address potential biases, an instrumental variable approach is employed, using city river lengths to proxy dialect diversity, and the results confirm the conclusions. The study also provides empirical evidence that the costs and benefits of regional cultural diversity on rural workers' income can be attributed to decreased social cohesion and enhanced innovation."
Cultural diversity in unequal societies sustained through cross-cultural competence and identity valuation,"In today's political landscape, cherished cultural traits are perceived to be under siege when encountering individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds, such as migrant populations or dominant social groups. Paradoxically, these interactions can cultivate cross-cultural proficiency, enabling effective communication across cultural divides. Despite this, prevailing theories of cultural evolution overlook this phenomenon, implying that cultural diversity is incompatible with harmonious inter-group relations and fueling anxieties about cultural erosion. A study employing in-depth interviews at an Amazonian cultural frontier reveals the widespread existence of cross-cultural proficiency. These findings inform a novel mathematical model that incorporates competing pathways to cross-cultural proficiency and group identity valuation, shedding light on how a common strategy employed by marginalized groups can, counterintuitively, preserve cultural diversity within a single generation: When group identity is strong, minorities in an unequal, yet inclusive, society can maintain their unique cultural norms by adopting those of the dominant group. Moreover, rather than rejecting or threatening the dominant culture, the appreciation of a distinct minority identity can define individuals who embody cross-cultural proficiency, committed to extensive, mutually beneficial engagement with the dominant group as members of a cohesive, multicultural society."
