This concept arises from the shift of a centralized network, controlled by a single entity, organization, or collective, to a distributed one. This distribution diminishes the need for user trust, as reliance on a central authority is minimized. However, this decentralization can potentially limit system functionality. Control over this decentralized system is achieved through smart contracts. This work introduces a novel blockchain decentralization system built on smart contracts generated by blocks, termed ""smart blockchain"" or ""smart chain."" This next-generation blockchain network accommodates one or more smart contracts, facilitating precise and reliable data collection through its decentralized structure. The absence of a single point of control or vulnerability makes smart blockchain resilient to tampering, hacking, and other malicious acts. This decentralized system also enables data storage and registration in new blocks, with the entire transaction process automated, eliminating human intervention. Networks currently utilizing blockchain, such as Ethereum, could potentially be replaced with smart blockchain or smart chain. The deployment and registration challenges associated with smart contracts are addressed within the smart blockchain framework. This study focuses on four key processes: new_block, new_transaction, last_block, and hash, using the Flask framework for communication and fulfillment of requests via HTTP protocol. Further exploration of this smart blockchain-enabled decentralized system holds significant potential for advancements in various application domains, including IoT-based Smart Homes.

Emoji as gesture in digital communication: Emoji improve comprehension of indirect speech,"The increasing prevalence of digital communication necessitates effective textual communication. However, textual communication lacks the nuances of other modalities, like hand gestures, which aid in understanding and resolving ambiguities in spoken language by offering visual cues. This study investigates whether emoji, pictorial symbols used to enrich text-based communication, can serve a similar purpose. Focusing on indirect speech, inherently ambiguous and requiring contextual interpretation, this research examines if emoji facilitate comprehension. Adapting gesture-based research (Kelly et al., 1999, Experiment 2) to a digital format, the study involved participants interpreting twelve hypothetical text message conversations concluding with indirect speech presented in three formats: text-only, text with emoji, and emoji-only. Results mirrored the positive impact of hand gestures on comprehension. Emoji demonstrably enhanced understanding, with participants interpreting indirect speech more accurately in the emoji-only condition compared to both text+emoji and text-only conditions, and improved comprehension in the text+emoji condition over the text-only condition. Therefore, emoji are not simply decorative elements but actively contribute to communication by clarifying and disambiguating intricate messages. Akin to gestures in face-to-face interactions, emoji enhance comprehension in text-based communication.

Can Conservatives Be Persuaded? Framing Effects on Support for Universal Basic Income in the US,"As automation and socioeconomic disparities increase, universal basic income (UBI) is often suggested as a solution. However, data reveals significant resistance to this welfare concept, especially among conservatives in Europe and the United States. This research investigates if reframing UBI through a conservative lens can mitigate this opposition. By aligning UBI with conservative values like individual liberty and limited government intervention, a unique survey experiment was designed. Participants were randomly presented with one of two perspectives: an ""equalizing-opportunity"" frame emphasizing UBI's potential to level the playing field and foster self-reliance, or a ""limiting-government"" frame highlighting its ability to streamline government and reduce bureaucracy.  The study discovered that American conservatives, identified through their stance on 10 policy statements, remained strongly against UBI, even after exposure to these tailored frames.  This conclusion is further bolstered by an analysis of open-ended responses, which demonstrated that conservative reasoning against UBI was consistent regardless of framing.  Even when emphasizing aspects of UBI that aligned with conservative ideology, their opposition stayed firm.  These findings provide valuable insights into the challenges of framing UBI for political acceptance and the entrenched nature of welfare attitudes among American conservatives.

Are ‘red wall’ constituencies really opposed to progressive policy? Examining the impact of materialist narratives for Universal Basic Income,"While UBI is frequently lauded as theoretically sound, it is often perceived as politically impractical. Legislators anticipate resistance from socially conservative demographics who, despite standing to gain financially from the policy, might reject it as an unearned handout. However, research conducted in traditionally working-class regions of England and Wales challenges this assumption. Study 1 reveals significant public backing for UBI, with different narrative strategies resonating with various groups based on their economic circumstances. Study 2, employing an innovative collaborative approach, demonstrates that straightforward messaging can substantially boost support for UBI, even amongst those initially expressing strong opposition. Notably, these narratives emphasized the tangible, positive impacts of implementing UBI, rather than aligning with abstract values. This suggests that policymakers should reconsider relying on values-based arguments to explain policy preferences.

"Robots, labor markets, and universal basic income","The pervasive nature of automation in contemporary societies has sparked significant concern due to its impact on various socioeconomic facets, including income, employment, and productivity. While prior research has primarily focused on the effects of automation on jobs and wages, this study seeks to understand how automation influences productivity and how policies such as robot taxes or universal basic income might mitigate or exacerbate these effects. An experiment was conducted in which workers made decisions regarding their productive effort, while managers had the option of selecting either workers or robots for task completion. The baseline treatment measured the effort exerted by workers who faced potential replacement by robots and elicited firm replacement decisions. Subsequent treatments introduced a universal basic income equivalent to approximately one-fifth of the median worker wage or a tax levied on firms that replaced workers with robots. The impact of automation was further explored by examining the coexistence of workers and robots in part-time job scenarios. The findings revealed that the possibility of robot substitution did not influence the level of effort exerted by workers. Moreover, neither universal basic income nor a robot tax resulted in a decrease in worker effort. However, the robot substitution tax was found to reduce the likelihood of worker replacement. Interestingly, workers who benefited from managerial decisions to retain them despite the availability of more productive robots did not exhibit increased effort levels. These conclusions provide insights into the intricate relationship between policy and worker behavior in an era of widespread automation.

A global conservation basic income to safeguard biodiversity,"To achieve a truly sustainable future, biodiversity protection efforts must prioritize inclusivity, fairness, and the recognition of diverse values. The conservation basic income (CBI), a novel concept involving direct cash transfers to residents of critical conservation zones, could be instrumental in driving this fundamental change in our approach to conservation. This study offers a thorough cost analysis of implementing CBI globally, utilizing spatial modeling across three plausible future conservation scenarios. The projected gross costs exhibit significant variability based on the targeted areas and populations, ranging from US$351 billion to US$6.73 trillion per year. For example, providing a daily CBI of US$5.50 within existing protected areas in low- and middle-income nations would amount to US$478 billion annually. While these figures are substantial compared to current governmental conservation expenditures (approximately US$133 billion in 2020), they represent a potentially prudent investment in preserving the invaluable social and ecological benefits derived from nature, including the estimated US$44 trillion in global economic output reliant on natural resources.

Erosion and Corrosion of Pipelines and Equipment on the Power Uprate of Power Units at Nuclear Power Plants (NPP),"Modern nuclear power generation increasingly focuses on augmenting electrical output and cost efficiency by boosting the thermal power of existing reactors, a process known as power uprating (PU). This involves enhancing reactor thermal capacity and refining turbine efficiency. Typically, thermal power increases range from 2% to 20% above nominal levels, a practice particularly prevalent in the US and Europe. Power uprating often necessitates modifications to turbines, condensers, generators, and other components. These adjustments alter operational parameters such as temperature, pressure, and steam wetness, consequently influencing the rate of erosion-corrosion in working surfaces within the system. This accelerated wear can potentially shorten the remaining lifespan of equipment and pipelines by reducing the time to reach maximum allowable wall thinning. International computational analyses indicate that erosion-corrosion rates in specific pipelines and equipment groups can escalate by over 50% following power uprating. Consequently, US licensing for power uprating mandates computational assessments using specialized software to pinpoint areas susceptible to heightened erosion-corrosion. Since 2009, Russian nuclear facilities have employed the RAMEK software for predicting erosion-corrosion rates in pipeline and equipment components. Notably, practical experience reveals that power uprating can not only accelerate erosion-corrosion in intricate flow path geometries but also intensify cavitation and droplet impact erosion. This underscores the significance of computational and experimental investigations to evaluate the influence of modified operating conditions on the rate and distribution of erosion-corrosion wear in pipelines and equipment.

Basic social justice orientations—measuring order-related justice in the European Social Survey Round 9,"People possess beliefs about how goods and responsibilities should be fairly allocated within a society. These beliefs, which inform judgments about existing disparities, are rooted in four fundamental principles: (1) Equality advocates for an even distribution of benefits and burdens. (2) Need considers individual contributions, while (3) equity proposes distribution based on merit. Lastly, (4) entitlement posits that inherent traits (like gender) and earned statuses (such as job prestige) should dictate the allocation of resources and obligations.  Previous studies suggest that preferences for these principles are influenced by both individual social standing and the broader societal structure.  A tool called the Basic Social Justice Orientations (BSJO) scale was created to gauge agreement with these four justice principles, but its use had been limited to Germany.  Round 9 of the European Social Survey (ESS R9, with data gathered in 2018/2019) marked the first inclusion of four BSJO scale items (one per principle) in a multinational survey, providing a unique chance to examine variations within and across nations. This report contributes to substantive research on preferences for equality, equity, need, and entitlement by evaluating the measurement quality in 29 European countries using ESS R9 data.  By analyzing response patterns, non-response rates, reliability, and relationships with relevant variables, we find encouraging evidence that the four BSJO items in ESS R9 yield low non-response, reliably gauge agreement with the four distributive principles, and exhibit anticipated correlations with related concepts. However, researchers should bear in mind that the BSJO scale, as implemented in ESS R9, offers only overt indicators, which might not encompass the full range of the underlying distributive principles but instead concentrate on specific facets.

Employing advanced statistical methods, the study revealed significant correlations between procedural justice, social identity, and police legitimacy. Notably, social identity acts as a key mediator, but not a moderator, in the relationship between procedural justice and legitimacy.  The strength of the correlation between procedural justice and legitimacy varied based on demographic factors like age and national development.  This investigation underscores the crucial role of social identity in shaping perceptions of legitimacy and highlights its significance in the interplay between procedural fairness and policing. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the connection between procedural justice and legitimacy is not uniform but rather is influenced by social contexts and group affiliations. The study's theoretical implications are explored in detail.

Teachers’ Social Emotional Learning Competencies and Social Justice Teaching Beliefs and Associations with Children’s Prosocial Behavior and Community Engagement,"High-quality interactions with educators in extracurricular settings can cultivate prosocial skills in children. This study investigated the link between the social-emotional skills of instructors in a STEM program incorporating social-emotional learning and the prosocial conduct, civic participation, and peer interactions of elementary students.  The research also examined the potential influence of educators' social justice beliefs and student gender on these relationships. Findings revealed that instructors' emotional intelligence was negatively correlated with prosocial behavior only when their belief in social justice education was weak. Conversely, instructors' dedication to social-emotional learning positively predicted prosocial behavior.  Furthermore, instructors' emotional intelligence was positively associated with peer difficulties, but only among female students, and also positively correlated with community engagement. These results highlight the interconnectedness of educators' social-emotional learning capabilities and social justice pedagogy in nurturing prosocial competence and civic engagement in students, offering valuable insights for future research.

AI ethics and ordoliberalism 2.0: towards a ‘Digital Bill of Rights’,"This study explores the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence through the lens of 'ordoliberalism 2.0', a unique business ethics framework.  It posits that the current dialogue surrounding (generative) AI overemphasizes self-regulation by corporations and voluntary ethical guidelines, leading to insufficient governance structures. To rectify this, the paper proposes not only the establishment of legally binding regulations with robust oversight mechanisms but also the integration of existing AI guidelines into a regulatory and competition policy informed by ordoliberal principles. This crucial connection between AI ethics, regulation, and antitrust remains underexplored in both scholarly and broader discussions. Consequently, this work addresses a significant void in the academic literature, enriching the predominantly legal, political, and philosophical discourse on AI governance. The paper's research objectives are twofold: firstly, it identifies ordoliberal-inspired ethical principles for AI that could underpin a 'digital bill of rights'. Secondly, it demonstrates how these principles can be applied at a systemic level through ordoliberal competition and regulatory policy.

Reflections on Putting AI Ethics into Practice: How Three AI Ethics Approaches Conceptualize Theory and Practice,"Contemporary critiques of applied ethics in artificial intelligence (AI) highlight an overreliance on abstract principles, leading to a disconnect between theoretical ideals and practical implementation. Various approaches attempt to bridge this divide by translating ethical theories into real-world applications. This article investigates how leading AI ethics approaches operationalize ethical principles in practice, focusing on three prominent frameworks: embedded ethics, ethically aligned design, and Value Sensitive Design (VSD). Each approach is analyzed based on its understanding and conceptualization of theory and practice, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses. Embedded ethics prioritizes context but risks being unduly influenced by it. Ethically aligned approaches emphasize principles but lack robust justification frameworks for navigating conflicts between competing values. The interdisciplinary VSD approach centers stakeholder values but requires stronger connections to political, legal, and social governance structures. To address these limitations, a meta-framework for applied AI ethics is proposed, comprising three key dimensions grounded in critical theory. These dimensions encourage critical reflection on the conceptualization of theory and practice. The first dimension emphasizes the integration of affects and emotions in ethical decision-making, promoting sensitivity to vulnerabilities, experiences of disregard, and marginalization during AI development. The second dimension calls for the consideration of normative background theories, providing standards and criteria for prioritizing and evaluating competing principles in conflict situations. Lastly, the governance dimension underscores the importance of revealing power dynamics and integrating social, legal, technical, and political considerations for realizing ethical AI applications. This meta-framework acts as a reflective tool for understanding, mapping, and evaluating the theory-practice nexus within AI ethics approaches, ultimately aiming to address and overcome their inherent limitations.

Mitochondrial gene editing,"Alterations in the genetic material of mitochondria are linked to numerous serious illnesses for which there are currently no effective treatments. The presence of multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome often results in a situation called heteroplasmy, where both normal and altered mitochondrial DNA coexist within a single cell. The normal DNA can compensate for the dysfunctional DNA until a certain level of mutation is reached, at which point disease symptoms emerge. Despite significant scientific interest in mitochondrial genetics, the double membrane surrounding mitochondria posed a substantial obstacle to genetic modification. Nevertheless, in recent decades, researchers have found ways to alter mitochondrial DNA by delivering gene editing proteins that target specific DNA sequences. Specifically, mitochondria-targeted enzymes can cut and remove mutated mitochondrial DNA in cells containing both normal and mutated DNA, as well as in animal models. More recently, base editors have been modified to precisely change specific DNA bases within mitochondria. As a result, tools for modifying mitochondrial DNA are now available, holding the potential to transform the field of mitochondrial genetics. This comprehensive overview explores mitochondrial gene editing, providing information on choosing appropriate tools, best practices for experimental design, relevant analysis methods, and the specific applications and limitations associated with various technologies in this field.

Simulation of dual-purpose chicken breeding programs implementing gene editing,"Despite ethical debates surrounding its use, gene editing is seen as more acceptable when it enhances animal welfare.  One such welfare issue in poultry farming is the culling of male chicks due to their poor meat yield. While dual-purpose breeds could address this, the inherent trade-off between egg and meat production traits limits their effectiveness.  Gene editing, though ethically contentious, could expedite the development of competitive dual-purpose chickens, mitigating the ethical concerns associated with culling.

A simulated study evaluated the potential benefits of gene editing in dual-purpose chicken breeding, comparing two approaches: enhancing existing laying hens and creating a synthetic line from a broiler-layer cross. Each approach was simulated with and without gene editing. The simulations incorporated polygenic breeding values and 500 quantitative trait loci (QTL) with varying degrees of pleiotropy, resulting in negative correlations between egg production, meat production, and overall health.  The results showed that gene editing could accelerate genetic gain by up to 81% for several generations, depending on the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) edited per animal. However, after 20 generations, the rate of genetic improvement became comparable in scenarios with and without gene editing. This convergence occurred because the remaining QTL had small effects, and editing them could negatively impact overall health due to potential off-target edits. 

This study highlights the potential of gene editing to simultaneously improve negatively correlated traits. However, given the inherent risks associated with gene editing, the number of SNPs targeted for editing should be carefully considered to maximize genetic gain while minimizing potential adverse effects.

Government size and automation,"This study investigates the impact of automation on government finances. The findings suggest that as automation becomes more prevalent, the relative size of the government, as indicated by the ratio of fiscal revenue to economic output, shrinks. This trend arises from the replacement of conventional, taxable inputs with automated technologies. The authors attribute these results to the influence of automation on labor markets, given that taxes on labor income, encompassing social security contributions, constitute the primary source of government revenue in most developed economies. Two hypothetical scenarios are examined. In the first, the authors determine how individual tax rates would need to be adjusted in response to automation to maintain consistent fiscal revenue streams from various tax sources. This analysis reveals that such a fiscal policy would have significant negative consequences for both economic output and employment, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive overhaul of the existing tax structure to mitigate the effects of automation on government finances. In the second scenario, the authors calculate the capital tax rate necessary to preserve the size of the government without altering other tax rates.

A conceptual framework for automation disengagements,"Enhanced comprehension of scenarios leading to automation deactivation can significantly bolster the safety and performance of automated technologies. This investigation delves into the reasons behind such deactivations, initiated by both human users and the automated system itself, by meticulously analyzing semi-structured interviews conducted with 103 individuals utilizing Tesla's Autopilot and FSD Beta systems. These reasons are systematically categorized, resulting in the identification of five primary categories and thirty-five subcategories. These overarching categories encompass the human operator's internal states (5 subcategories), their perception of the automation's behavior (17 subcategories), their understanding of other human reactions (3 subcategories), the automation's assessment of the human operator (3 subcategories), and limitations in the automation's capabilities within specific environments (7 subcategories). Human users deactivated the automation when they foresaw potential system errors, detected unusual or undesirable automation actions (e.g., erratic steering, disregarding traffic signals), or concluded that the automation lacked the capacity to function safely under certain conditions (e.g., adverse weather, unconventional road layouts). Negative user experiences, such as frustration, compromised safety perceptions, and a lack of trust, represent some of the detrimental human operator states prompting deactivations. Conversely, the automation continuously monitors user engagement and deactivates itself upon detecting inadequate user attention or violations of speed regulations. Furthermore, user behavior can be swayed by the responses of passengers and other road users, leading to deactivation if they perceive discomfort, anger, or embarrassment stemming from the automation's actions. This analysis culminates in a conceptual framework for understanding automation deactivations, integrating principles from human factors research and control theory. This study offers valuable insights into the factors contributing to automation deactivation, emphasizing not only the concerns of human users but also the social dynamics intertwined with this phenomenon. The findings provide critical information about potential edge cases within automated vehicle technology, which can contribute to enhancing both the safety and efficacy of such systems.

Cultural diversity in unequal societies sustained through cross-cultural competence and identity valuation,"Modern political rhetoric frequently frames interactions with culturally distinct groups, like immigrants or dominant majorities, as threats to cherished cultural values.  Such exchanges often cultivate intercultural competence (ICC), the capacity for successful cross-cultural engagement.  Yet, prevalent theories on cultural dynamics often overlook ICC, presenting cultural diversity and positive intergroup relations as incompatible, thereby fueling anxieties around cultural erosion.  Ethnographic research conducted at an Amazonian ethnic boundary reveals the widespread presence of ICC.  Inspired by these findings, a novel theoretical model, incorporating competing pathways for ICC and group identity development, illuminates a seemingly paradoxical strategy employed by marginalized groups to preserve cultural diversity within a single generation:  In structurally unequal, yet integrative societies, strong group identity allows minorities to retain unique cultural practices by acquiring the majority's cultural norms.  Moreover, rather than signifying a rejection or threat to the dominant culture, valuing a distinct minority identity can be a hallmark of individuals possessing ICC who actively engage with the majority in a mutually beneficial manner, contributing to an integrated, multicultural society.
