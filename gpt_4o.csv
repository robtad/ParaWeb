Peer relationship increasing the risk of social media addiction among Chinese adolescents who have negative emotions,"The reach and means of personal communication have been broadened by social media, which also brings the potential danger of social media addiction. This research detailed the psychometric properties of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) and examined the moderating influence of peer relationships on the link between negative emotions and the likelihood of social media addiction. A total of 1258 individuals participated in an online survey, completing various scales. Through exploratory structural equation modeling, BSMAS was found to exhibit a robust one-factor structure with a reliable internal consistency coefficient. The analysis of criterion-related validity and explained variance suggested a positive correlation between negative emotions and the risk of social media addiction while noting the significant impact of negative emotions and peer relationships. Moderation analysis revealed that peer relationships enhanced the effect of negative emotions on the risk of social media addiction, whereas gender did not serve as a moderator. The BSMAS proved to be a valid measure for assessing the risk of social media addiction in Chinese adolescents. Ultimately, peer relationships were identified as a beneficial moderator in the context of negative emotions and social media addiction risk."
A novel machine learning and face recognition technique for fake accounts detection system on cyber social networks,"Online Social Networks (OSNs) like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others have experienced swift expansion in recent times. These platforms offer engaging online social frameworks, allowing users to interact with family and friends, meet new individuals, join groups, chat, share images, plan events, and connect with peers similarly to real-life interactions. However, they also pose privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we identified threats within OSNs and suggested a digital face-processing authentication approach as a two-factor authentication method following password entry using Matlab. Utilizing deep learning classification with data gathered from a live webcam for model training, we achieved an optimal accuracy rate of 95%. Despite this, such techniques have yet to be widely adopted across all social networks. Hence, we also addressed the issue of fake accounts, a major challenge in OSNs. These accounts are potent tools for launching spam campaigns and disseminating malware and phishing schemes. Fake profiles can result in financial losses for companies, reputational damage, information theft for malicious activities, and more. This research focuses on distinguishing fake and authentic profiles within OSNs. We analyzed two datasets containing fake and real accounts on Facebook and Instagram, each with distinct attributes. After applying machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor, Boosted Tree, Neural Networks, SVM Kernel, and Logistic Regression Kernel, the SVM classifier yielded the highest accuracy in detecting fake profiles, with a rate of 97.1%."
Linking health impact and Post-environmental impact assessments: a case of municipal sewage treatment plant volatile organic compounds,"Current health impact assessments (HIA) and environmental impact assessments (EIA) have notable deficiencies. To address gaps in EIA theory, a case study on odors from a municipal sewage treatment plant (MSTP) was conducted, using geographic factors to link the spatial spread of pollutants with population activities classified by land-use characteristics. After identifying priority pollutants from the MSTP, odors, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia were chosen for study. Spatial parameters for pollutant modeling, including meteorological analysis, environmental emission monitoring, and emission source analysis, were then collected, and pollutant diffusion was predicted. Human activity types and exposure patterns were organized by land-use attributes. The spatial diffusion of pollutants was integrated with the exposure profiles of the local population using corresponding spatial coordination factors. The typical HIA risk calculation method was applied and expanded with spatial techniques in our study. The resulting HIA contour maps for the scenario are presented, highlighting the acceptable levels of odor pollutants from the MSTP in relation to geography. This study explores a significant method for linking HIA with post-EIA through spatial factors and addresses the shortcomings of HIA in empirical EIA applications."

This research investigated how Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) influence team training for paramedic learners. The study adopted a quasi-experimental, cross-sectional, controlled comparison methodology, categorizing participants into an experimental group (EG) using mixed reality with a manikin, and a control group (CG) utilizing virtual reality without a manikin. Post-simulation, participants were assessed on ""VR sickness,"" presence, motivation, and demographic variables. Analysis through parametric tests was used to compare mean scores and identify correlations. Twenty participants were evaluated in the EG and sixteen in the CG. Findings demonstrated high intrinsic motivation (mean 5.32/7), acceptable spatial presence (mean 4.24/6), and good usability (mean 68.54/100) in both groups, despite reports of VR sickness (SSQ total score: 11.43). Positive correlations were seen between identified regulation and usability (EG: r = .74, p < .001; CG: r = .76, p < .001), intrinsic motivation and usability (EG: r = .83, p < .001; CG: r = .70, p = .003), and spatial presence and usability (EG: r = .71, p < .001; CG: r = .61, p = .01) across both groups. There was a notable mean score difference in amotivation between the EG (mean 1.92/6) and CG (mean 1.56/6, p = .021). VR and MR can be effective learning tools when thoughtfully implemented by knowledgeable instructors. We recommend the use of preparation checklists, a competence-focused approach, recognition of implicit agreements, structured debriefing, wireless head-mounted displays, and ""data gloves."""

"Lightness constancy in reality, in virtual reality, and on flat-panel displays","Virtual reality (VR) displays are being employed across a growing array of applications. Research indicates, however, that there are often significant differences in how viewers perceive scenes in real versus virtual settings. Therefore, concluding that virtual stimuli offer realistic perception requires careful testing rather than assumptions. One key aspect for realistic scene perception is surface color. To assess how well VR platforms provide realistic perception of achromatic surface color, we measured lightness constancy using a physical setup with real lights and surfaces, a commercial VR headset, and a traditional flat-panel display. The results showed that lightness constancy was effective in all three settings, although it was notably superior in the real environment compared to the flat-panel display. Additionally, we observed greater variability among observers in both VR and the flat-panel display than in the physical environment. These findings suggest that such discrepancies should be considered in applications where accurate perception is crucial, but also highlight that VR can often serve as a versatile alternative to flat-panel displays and a reasonable stand-in for real environments."
Exploratory analysis of the effectiveness of virtual reality in cardiovascular rehabilitation,"Research indicates that virtual reality therapy can effectively help manage psychological disorders in individuals with cardiovascular disease. The effectiveness of such therapy in a virtual setting may be influenced by age. Consequently, this study aimed to assess whether there are age-related disparities in reducing depression and anxiety through virtual reality psychological interventions utilized for rehabilitation. The study involved 25 patients under 65 and 25 patients aged 65 and over, all diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, who underwent virtual reality therapy for anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression levels were evaluated before and after the intervention using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Notable declines in anxiety and depression scores post-intervention were observed in both age groups, with no significant differences between younger and older participants. Further analysis did not indicate that age impacts the effectiveness of virtual reality therapy in reducing anxiety and depressive disorders. The findings suggest that older patients benefit equally to their younger counterparts from virtual reality psychological interventions, and age should not be considered a predictor of the therapy's effectiveness in alleviating anxiety and depression in cardiovascular disease patients."

Despite its promising potential in healthcare, the integration of VR into clinical practice remains in its early stages and faces several implementation challenges. Successful integration could enhance the adoption, utilization, and effectiveness of VR, but the implementation process is still under-explored in practical terms. This scoping review aimed to assess the current landscape of VR implementation in healthcare settings and identify factors that influence this process.

Methods
A scoping review of literature up to February 2022 was conducted, following the methodological guidelines of Arksey and O’Malley (2005). Databases including Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were systematically searched to find studies focused on the implementation of VR in healthcare. Data from each study were extracted using a structured form.

Results
Out of 5523 records, 29 were included in the analysis. Most studies examined the barriers and facilitators to implementation, identifying common factors related to adopter behavior and the organizational resources required. However, few studies addressed systematic implementation guided by theoretical frameworks. While the use of a structured, multi-level approach to meet stakeholder needs is recommended, no clear link between identified barriers, specific implementation objectives, and strategies to overcome these barriers was found in the reviewed articles.

Conclusion
Advancing VR implementation in healthcare requires a comprehensive approach, not fragmented studies focusing on single elements like healthcare provider-related barriers, which is prevalent in current literature. This study suggests that a holistic implementation framework should encompass the entire process—from identifying barriers to developing and deploying a coherent, multi-level intervention with effective strategies.

Consequently, the concept of blockchain equity tokens remains speculative. Moreover, existing literature does not provide design theories for creating and implementing these tokens. This study addresses this gap by crafting, developing, and assessing a prototype for equity tokens in crowdfunding, utilizing the design science research methodology. We introduce an improved crowdfunding framework and establish seven design principles that enhance the theoretical foundation of equity tokens. The findings demonstrate that blockchain-based equity tokens boost efficiency, ensure transparency, and promote interoperability, all while complying with regulatory standards and supporting secondary market trading."
A scalable blockchain storage scheme for VANET,"Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) enable technologies like autonomous driving, active safety systems, and smart cities. Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET), as the backbone of ITSs, is crucial for traffic safety and enhancing driving comfort and experience. However, VANET encounters several challenges due to its public exposure and the sensitive nature of the information it handles, such as vehicle control commands and driving logs. While blockchain technology offers benefits like decentralization, immutability, trustlessness, and traceability, most current blockchain implementations demand substantial storage and computational power from participating nodes. This poses a problem for VANET's terminal nodes, such as road-side units (RSUs), on-board units (OBUs), and sensors, which typically have limited storage and computational capabilities. To address this issue, this paper presents a blockchain system designed to provide scalable storage capacity for VANETs. The proposed approach utilizes network sharding and a multi-consensus strategy to enhance the blockchain's topology and consensus process. A collaborative storage mechanism combined with a dynamic copy number strategy for the blockchain ledger is implemented to reduce the storage requirements on RSU nodes. Experimental results indicate that, compared to existing solutions, the proposed scalable blockchain storage scheme drastically reduces the storage demands on blockchain nodes, enabling those with limited storage capacity in VANET to participate in blockchain maintenance. This prevents the blockchain from becoming centralized and supports the extensive sharing of road traffic information while ensuring the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of the data."

Can emojis (images used to enhance text communication) serve a similar role? This study explores whether emojis enhance the understanding of indirect speech. Indirect speech is ambiguous, and its proper comprehension relies on the receiver interpreting contextual clues, such as hand gestures. We adapted gesture conditions from previous research (Kelly et al., 1999, Experiment 2) into a digital, text-based context using emojis instead of gestures. Participants interpreted 12 hypothetical text-message exchanges featuring indirect speech in three conditions: text only, text+emoji, or emoji only, in a between-subjects design. Similar to the effect of hand gestures, emojis enhanced comprehension. Participants were better at accurately interpreting indirect speech in the emoji-only condition compared to the text+emoji and text-only conditions, and better in the text+emoji condition compared to the text-only condition. Therefore, emojis are not just decorative; they integrate with text to convey and clarify complex messages. Like hand gestures in face-to-face interactions, emojis enhance comprehension in text-based communication."

Operationalising AI ethics through the agile software development lifecycle: a case study of AI-enabled mobile health applications,"Despite the introduction of numerous ethical guidelines and principles to steer the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, effectively implementing these principles into practical applications remains a challenge, especially in the healthcare sector. This sector demands careful consideration and balance between the benefits of AI solutions and their potential risks to patients and broader communities, including marginalized and underserved groups. To tackle this issue, we advocate for a shift from generic ethical principles to specific, case-based frameworks. We illustrate our approach with a case study involving an AI-powered mobile health (mHealth) application. Our framework draws from established ethical guidelines and principles such as the AI4People framework, the EU’s High-Level Expert Group on Trustworthy AI, and broader human rights considerations, supplemented by relational viewpoints that address value concerns and moral conflicts between individual rights and public health. We adopt an ""ethics by design"" methodology, embedding ethical principles throughout the AI development lifecycle to ensure they are integral, not supplementary. In our case study, we identified seven key ethical principles: fairness, agility, precision, humanity, respect for others, trust and accountability, and robustness and reproducibility. We argue that the most effective way to manage and mitigate ethical impacts is by integrating these principles into standard software development practices. Furthermore, we provide practical examples of how our contextualized framework can be applied using AI-driven healthcare mobile applications."

Creation mechanism of new media art combining artificial intelligence and internet of things technology in a metaverse environment,"The Metaverse is envisioned as a novel virtual society built by advanced media, with new media art generated through innovative media technologies expected to gradually replace traditional art forms and play a significant role in the limitless Metaverse of the future. The development of new media art creation mechanisms will also rely on the support of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This study aims to investigate the style transfer of digital painting in new media art, specifically by using neural network technology in AI to reshape image styles while preserving the original image's semantic information. An image style transformation method based on feature synthesis is proposed, leveraging the feature mapping of both content and style images, combined with traditional texture synthesis techniques, to create a richer multi-style feature mapping. The inverse transformation of this target feature mapping is then restored to an image to achieve style transformation. Additionally, the research results are analyzed, demonstrating that integrating AI and IoT optimizes new media art creation mechanisms. For digital art style transformation, the Tensorflow framework was employed for simulation and performance evaluation. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed feature synthesis-based image style transfer method can sensibly distribute image textures and alter style textures while retaining more of the original image's semantic structure, generating richer artistic effects, enhanced interactivity, and improved local controllability.

Humans versus AI: whether and why we prefer human-created compared to AI-created artwork,"In light of the burgeoning development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) models that can replicate human-created art, AI-generated artworks might emerge as substitutes for human creativity. However, critics dispute the likelihood of this scenario, suggesting that the intrinsic value we place on the human experience within art plays a crucial role, irrespective of the art's physical attributes. This raises a compelling issue regarding whether and why individuals may favor human-produced over AI-generated art. To investigate, researchers conducted an experiment where they randomly assigned either a “Human-created” or “AI-created” label to AI-generated paintings and then evaluated participants' perceptions of the artworks based on four criteria: Liking, Beauty, Profundity, and Worth. The first study revealed that artwork labeled as human-made received more favorable evaluations across all criteria compared to those labeled as AI-made. The second study sought not only to replicate but also to expand on these results by including additional ratings (Emotion, Story, Meaningfulness, Effort, and Time to create) to understand why human-labeled art received higher appraisals. The replication confirmed the initial findings, showing that labels influenced sensory-level judgments (Liking, Beauty), with narrativity (Story) and perceived effort (Effort) acting as moderators. For more communicative judgments (Profundity, Worth), personal positive attitudes towards AI moderated the label effects. Overall, these studies indicate a prevalent bias against AI-generated art compared to human-labeled art, emphasizing that the perceived human involvement in the artistic process enhances the appraisal of artworks."

Recently, there have been significant advancements in low-concentration optics like Dielectric-based Compound Parabolic Concentrators (DiCPCs), driving interest in Building Integrated Concentrating Photovoltaic (BICPV) glazing to boost light collection and electrical output. Traditional BIPV glazing systems often struggle with dynamically controlling daylight and solar heat transmission to adapt to changing weather and seasonal heating or cooling needs. Integrating optically switchable smart materials into BIPV glazing systems offers a promising solution, providing dynamic daylight management along with solar power generation. Thermotropic (TT) hydrogel materials, such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) and Hydroxypropyl Cellulose (HPC), are ideal for hybrid BIPV smart glazing applications due to their high visible transparency in clear state, strong light-scattering ability in translucent state, and significant solar energy modulation. This review examines various types of electricity-generating glazing technologies including BIPV and BICPV glazing, as well as smart glazing technologies with a special emphasis on TT hydrogel integrated glazing. It assesses the properties, advantages, and limitations of hybrid BIPV smart glazing and discusses the challenges and research opportunities in this burgeoning field."
Performance evaluation of monocrystalline and polycrystalline-based solar cell,"This study demonstrates the efficiency of solar cells made from crystalline materials (both polycrystalline and monocrystalline) and provides a comparative analysis of their performance based on various orientations within a solar plant. Due to the rapidly increasing global energy demand, various renewable energy sources have been employed in recent decades to meet this growing need worldwide, with recent research identifying solar energy as the most promising. The performance analysis was conducted at a geographical location in Savar, Dhaka, with coordinates 23.8538° latitude and 90.2534° longitude. The study identified the most effective polycrystalline and monocrystalline solar cells, rated at 440 Wp and 370 Wp respectively. A grid-connected PV system of 12.3 kWp was modeled, revealing that monocrystalline cells achieved a performance ratio of 83.55%, surpassing the 79.6% ratio of polycrystalline cells. When considering various orientations, monocrystalline cells on dual-axis tracking systems injected the most energy into the grid at 25.8 MWh/year, compared to the 20.6 MWh/year from fixed orientation systems. For polycrystalline cells, the figures were 23.9 MWh/year and 19.5 MWh/year for dual-axis tracking and fixed orientation systems, respectively. Overall, monocrystalline cells consistently injected more energy into the grid and achieved a higher performance ratio across all orientations."
Geometrical Optimization of 2D MoS2-Ag Rectangular and Triangular Grating for Enhanced Solar Cell Efficiency,"Maximizing solar energy technology's capabilities necessitates innovative methodologies to enhance light absorption in solar cells. This research presents a groundbreaking exploration of MoS2-Ag rectangular and triangular grating structures to attain this objective. Utilizing finite element analysis via the COMSOL 5.3a RF module allows investigation into different silver (Ag) grating configurations' effects on light absorption in photovoltaic (PV) cells. To determine the optimal combination of MoS2 thickness, slit width, and metal grating while maintaining consistent grating periodicity, a precise value is calculated. The zeroth-order transmission spectra and near-field plots of the Fano-resonance associated with SPP elicitation are meticulously examined. Our results indicate that a specific rectangular grating configuration, with a MoS2 thickness of 50 nm and slit width around half or slightly more than half of the periodicity, significantly boosts light absorption. This study not only highlights the pivotal influence of grating geometry on solar cell performance but also sets the stage for future improvements in solar energy technologies. By conducting both far-field and near-field analyses and applying rigorous statistical verification, our research provides a solid model for the geometrical optimization of grating structures, offering profound insights into the potential of these technologies to enhance solar energy utilization."
Can Conservatives Be Persuaded? Framing Effects on Support for Universal Basic Income in the US,"Universal basic income (UBI) has been suggested as a policy solution to address technological progress and structural inequity. However, current data reveals that a majority of conservatives in Europe and the United States are highly against this welfare proposal. Is it possible to mitigate this opposition by framing UBI in a way that aligns with their ideological beliefs? By aligning UBI with fundamental conservative principles like individualism and minimal government intervention, I developed a unique survey experiment. Respondents were randomly assigned one of two frames: (1) an equalizing-opportunity frame, which underscores UBI's role in creating fair opportunities and encouraging self-reliance, or (2) a limiting-government frame, which portrays UBI as a policy that curtails government and reduces bureaucracy. The findings indicate that American conservatives—identified through 10 policy statements—showed persistent opposition to UBI even after exposure to these frames. Analysis of open-ended responses revealed that conservatives' reasons for opposing UBI remained unchanged regardless of the framing. This inflexible stance highlights the challenges of framing UBI in a politically feasible manner and the persistent aversion to welfare policies among American conservatives."
Are ‘red wall’ constituencies really opposed to progressive policy? Examining the impact of materialist narratives for Universal Basic Income,"Universal Basic Income (UBI), despite being theoretically appealing, is often considered politically unfeasible. Policymakers worry about instinctual, value-driven objections from socially conservative voters who would economically benefit from UBI but may view it as 'handing out freebies.' Research from ‘red wall’ areas in Wales, the Midlands, and Northern England, however, contradicts this assumption. Study 1 reveals substantial support for UBI, with narrative framings resonating differently based on individuals’ material needs. Study 2 employs a novel 'adversarial collaboration' approach, demonstrating that straightforward narratives emphasizing UBI's tangible benefits can significantly boost support, even among those initially opposed. This suggests policymakers should be wary of using value-based justifications to explain voter preferences."
"Robots, labor markets, and universal basic income","The extensive influence of automation on various socioeconomic factors, including income, employment, and productivity, raises significant concerns in contemporary societies. While earlier research has primarily focused on evaluating the effects on job markets and wages, this study seeks to explore automation's impact on productivity and the role of specific policies, such as robot taxes or universal basic income, in moderating these outcomes. To achieve this, an experiment was structured where workers decide on their productivity levels, while managers select between employing humans or robots for tasks. In the initial setup, the effort levels of employees at risk of being replaced by robots and the firms' decisions to replace them are assessed. Following this, additional scenarios are tested in which employees either receive a universal basic income equating to approximately 20% of the median wages or firms incur taxes for substituting workers with robots. The study also examines the dynamic of workers and robots coexisting in part-time roles to complete the analysis. Findings indicate that the potential threat of being replaced by robots does not alter the workers' effort levels. Furthermore, neither universal basic income nor a robot tax impacts worker effort. However, the imposition of a robot substitution tax diminishes the likelihood of workers being replaced. Lastly, employees who are retained over robots by managerial choice do not necessarily increase their effort. The conclusions shed light on how policy interventions can influence worker behavior amidst prevalent automation."
A global conservation basic income to safeguard biodiversity,"To support a global shift toward sustainable development, biodiversity conservation must be inclusive, equitable, just, and recognize diverse values. The Conservation Basic Income (CBI), an unconditional cash transfer to individuals living in key conservation regions, is proposed as a potent strategy for driving this transformative change in conservation efforts. This study offers detailed cost projections for implementing a global CBI, derived from spatial analyses of three potential future conservation scenarios. The estimated gross costs vary significantly, ranging from $351 billion to $6.73 trillion annually, based on the areas and populations covered. Implementing a $5.50 per day CBI in existing protected areas within low- and middle-income countries would amount to $478 billion annually. Although these figures are substantially higher compared to current governmental conservation expenditures (around $133 billion in 2020), they could be considered a prudent investment in preserving invaluable social and natural assets, as well as the roughly $44 trillion in global economic output that relies on nature."
Utilization of spent nuclear fuel and transuranic actinides in a two-component nuclear power industry,"As per Russia's nuclear power industry development strategy for the first half of the 21st century, the sector is expected to enter an initial phase of creating a dual-component nuclear power structure alongside a closed nuclear fuel cycle (NFC) infrastructure. This nuclear system should integrate all components, such as nuclear power plants (NPPs), uranium and uranium-plutonium fuel production facilities, spent nuclear fuel processing plants, and radioactive waste management setups, to ensure competitively priced electricity for both domestic and international markets. This article highlights the systemic advantages of widely adopting fast reactors within the Russian nuclear power sector by ensuring sustainable resource use and addressing key challenges at the final NFC stage, particularly the accumulation of spent fuel and transuranic actinides. The study proposes an optimal NFC closure scenario that resolves these issues without escalating the high parameters of the breeder reactor in a fast reactor and utilizing special burners."
Ion-Plasma Technology for Nuclear Power Plants Deactivation,"Abstract: To address the current challenges in nuclear power engineering, specifically the deactivation of irradiated reactor graphite and metal structures in nuclear plants, we have created an innovative ion-plasma technology. This technology's effectiveness has been experimentally demonstrated on metal and reactor graphite samples under operational conditions for the first time."
Small Power Nuclear Plants: Technical Level and Prospects for Commercialization (Review),"Abstract
The ongoing expansion of the Arctic and the Northern Sea Route underscores the necessity for swift advancements in energy supply systems for secluded areas. Essential to these isolated power systems are small-scale energy sources. The steep expense of fossil fuels in remote locations, alongside stricter environmental policies, highlights the urgency of adopting carbon-neutral energy technologies. Low-power nuclear power plants, which are less influenced by weather variability and do not produce greenhouse gas emissions, are particularly promising. Currently, various countries are developing new reactor designs with electrical outputs of up to 300 MW: according to the IAEA, there are over 70 distinct projects underway. Features such as modularity, versatility (including capabilities for generating thermal energy and hydrogen), enhanced compactness, and reduced capital expenditure compared to conventional high-capacity power units make these low-power reactors attractive options. This review assesses the current challenges in designing and deploying these reactors. It examines the technical maturity of both domestic and international small modular reactor (SMR) projects. The review also identifies promising applications for the thermal energy produced by small modular units, considering present energy trends such as low-carbon and nuclear-hydrogen sectors. Moreover, it explores potential circuit configurations for electricity generation using advanced cycles and unconventional working fluids. The feasibility of commercializing small-scale nuclear power plant projects is discussed, though the issue of their successful business implementation remains unresolved."
Alien Fish Species in Cooling Ponds of Nuclear Power Plants and State District Power Stations of Central Russia,"The paper offers a comprehensive review of non-native fish species inhabiting cooling ponds at nuclear and state district power stations in Central Russia. It provides a succinct overview of the target reservoirs as habitats for thermophilic fish species uncommon to the native ichthyofauna in the area. The document narrates the history of these species introduction, their biological traits, their presence in catches, and their relevance to fisheries across six small, specially managed reservoirs within Moscow, Smolensk, Ryazan, and Kursk regions. It identifies the primary pathways through which these aquatic species have infiltrated cooling ponds and presents ichthyological monitoring data from the said reservoirs. Additionally, the forecast of the future population trends of these alien fish species is discussed, taking into account changes in the thermal environment of the reservoirs, stocking practices, and fishing pressure in the cooling ponds of nuclear and state district power stations in Central Russia."
Erosion and Corrosion of Pipelines and Equipment on the Power Uprate of Power Units at Nuclear Power Plants (NPP),"The evolution of the contemporary nuclear sector is marked by increasing the thermal power of functioning power units beyond the established rated levels to boost electricity production and cut costs. This practice is known as a power uprate (PU). It involves augmenting the thermal output of reactor units and enhancing the turbine unit's efficiency. Typically, the thermal power of NPP units in Russia and internationally is increased by 2–20% above the nominal level, a strategy predominantly adopted in the United States and Europe. Elevating a power unit's thermal power above the rated capacity may necessitate upgrades to turbines, condensers, electric generators, and other components. This power uprate alters the operating parameters of the equipment and pipelines, including working fluid conditions such as temperature, pressure, and steam moisture. Consequently, it may influence the erosion-corrosion rate of the metal on the working surfaces within the operational circuit, potentially reducing the residual service life until the maximum permissible thinning of equipment and pipeline walls is reached. Computational research by foreign experts indicates that, following a power uprate, the erosion-corrosion rate for certain pipelines and equipment groups can surge by over 50%. Therefore, in the United States, securing a license for the power uprate of an NPP unit necessitates computational analyses with software tools to pinpoint pipelines and equipment subject to increased erosion-corrosion rates. Since 2009, Russian nuclear power plants have utilized the RAMEK software code to forecast erosion-corrosion rates for pipeline and equipment components. It is acknowledged that practically, a power uprate can not only enhance the erosion-corrosion rate in intricately shaped elements within the flow path but also intensify the effects of cavitation and droplet impact erosion. The importance of computational and experimental studies is emphasized to evaluate the impact of altered operating conditions on the rate and distribution of erosion-corrosion wear in pipeline elements and equipment."
The Concept of a Nuclear Power Unit on the Basis of a Low-Power Multipurpose Test Research Reactor with Supercritical Light-Water Coolant,"In this abstract, an initial design concept for a nuclear power installation (NPI) is introduced, centered around a low-power multipurpose test research reactor with a supercritical pressure light water coolant (LMTRR-SCP). This system is capable of functioning as either a test or research reactor and offers several capabilities: validating the operational conditions for a supercritical water-cooled power reactor within a fast neutron spectrum; refining the reactor’s design operational regimes under supercritical coolant conditions (including startup, power level attainment, transition between power levels, standard operation, shutdown, etc.); irradiating new types of nuclear fuel and materials for reactors with various neutron spectra, including fast, intermediate, and thermal; conducting thorough experimental and computational studies to gather data essential for the development and validation of numerical models; assessing new equipment for various system processes, including emergency cooling systems and steam generators, as well as instrumentation for control, monitoring, and diagnostics of different power reactor types. The project also includes research on the closed nuclear fuel cycle (CNFC) issue, management of actinides and long-lived fission products, and demonstration of fuel cycle closure on a pilot scale. Additionally, it encompasses the development of processes for manufacturing radionuclide products for diverse uses, production of modified materials, and leveraging the reactor’s thermal energy for heat and electricity generation. There is also the potential for international cooperation through joint research initiatives based on LMTRR-SCP."
Anomaly detection for early ransomware and spyware warning in nuclear power plant systems based on FusionGuard,"Protecting critical infrastructure, especially nuclear power facilities, from new cyber threats requires cutting-edge cybersecurity strategies. This study presents FusionGuard, a hybrid anomaly detection system based on machine learning, created to provide early warnings of ransomware and spyware intrusions in nuclear power plant networks. Custom-designed to suit the specific features of these networks, FusionGuard utilizes varied datasets that capture normal operations and historical threats. Employing advanced machine learning algorithms, the system dynamically conforms to the network's typical behavior, effectively detecting deviations that signal ransomware or spyware activities. Thorough testing and validation with real-world data and simulated attacks demonstrate FusionGuard's capability to identify anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The research also examines the system's scalability and adaptability to changing attack methods, strengthening the cybersecurity framework of nuclear power plants in an evolving threat environment. Essentially, FusionGuard aims to enhance the security of nuclear power plant systems against ransomware and spyware by leveraging machine learning and anomaly detection, providing timely alerts and facilitating proactive measures, thus significantly contributing to the protection of critical infrastructure in high-stakes settings."
Intelligent planning of controllers for improved resilience in multi-area system involving nuclear power,"The rise in innovative methods to produce energy from various sources to satisfy increasing consumer demands has brought about numerous challenges in managing the power grid amid disruptions. This research paper introduces a novel strategy that integrates a controller with a soft computing technique called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to tackle these issues. The investigation focuses on a power system comprising four units, where three distinct energy sources are distributed between two regions. Each region houses two power sources: one region has a mix of thermal and gas power plants, while the other contains a nuclear power plant and a gas power plant. Transmitting power from the nuclear plant proves especially challenging due to its high susceptibility to disturbances, necessitating an intelligent and efficient controller for reliable control in such a network. Additionally, the paper provides an in-depth examination of the emissions from the various power plants, aiming to minimize the carbon impact associated with power generation. The proposed methodology and analyses are carried out using the MATLAB/SIMULINK platform."
Fire simulation in the main control room of Bushehr nuclear power plant using CFAST software,"Ensuring fire protection is crucial for the safety and risk mitigation of nuclear power plants. Within the safety evaluations, the main control room (MCR) is flagged as an area with significant fire risk. Despite effective programs for reactor shutdowns in fire scenarios, this study aims to model a fire in the MCR of Bushehr nuclear power plant unit‑1 (BNPP-1) using CFAST software. CFAST is a two-zone fire model designed to predict the progression of smoke, fire gases, and temperatures within building compartments amid a fire. Data for the simulation were sourced from the final safety analysis reports, operational documents of BNPP‑1, and NUREG6850 reports. Findings indicated that the highest temperature, around 1013°C, occurred in the upper section of the standing cabinet due to flames and heat transfer via smoke. Another significant temperature reading was approximately 700°C in the lower section of the standing cabinet. Additionally, the first ventilation system was shut for roughly 350 seconds, and the second for about 860 seconds after the fire ignited."
On the Road to Justice: Some Selected Suggestions for the Future of Social Justice Research,"This article reviews various elements of social justice research to evaluate the field's current status and propose enhancements and directions for future exploration. The issue of micro–macro-level interactions, including affirmative action policies, is examined. A selection of pertinent philosophers is introduced. The significant impact of justice principles on social change investigations, search conferences, and group interventions is showcased. The theoretical value of social justice can be augmented in multiple ways, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of recommendations and interventions. The integration of justice criteria into total quality management processes is explored. Modern quality management emphasizes the triple-P criteria—people, planet, and profit—which are highly pertinent to foundational and applied justice research. While the social justice field is in a good state, there is potential for further improvement. Ultimately, interdisciplinary research is identified as crucial for addressing complex societal and global challenges."
The Organizational Underpinnings of Social Justice Theory Development,"Traditional psychological frameworks regarding justice were established in an era when social justice was integral to social psychology. These frameworks have since influenced various disciplines focused on resolving social, political, and economic problems. However, changes within psychology have gradually sidelined social justice scholars, hindering the evolution of new theoretical advancements. This paper suggests structural adjustments to foster a new wave of researchers in social justice theory, a necessity given the rising prevalence and intensity of justice-related issues globally."
Basic social justice orientations—measuring order-related justice in the European Social Survey Round 9,"Individuals maintain normative beliefs about the fair allocation of resources and responsibilities within a society. These beliefs influence the assessment of current inequalities and are based on four fundamental principles: (1) Equality, which advocates for an even distribution of benefits and responsibilities; (2) Need, which considers individual contributions; (3) Equity, which proposes distribution according to merit; and (4) Entitlement, which argues that both ascribed (e.g., gender) and achieved characteristics (e.g., job status) should influence the distribution. Previous research indicates that preferences for these principles vary depending on social position and societal structure. The Basic Social Justice Orientations (BSJO) scale was designed to measure agreement with the four principles, but it has only been used in Germany until recently. For the first time, four items from the BSJO scale—one for each principle—were included in an international survey with Round 9 of the European Social Survey (ESS R9, data collected in 2018/2019), providing a unique chance to examine variations within and between countries. This report supplies evidence on the measurement quality in 29 European countries from ESS R9, aiding substantive research on preferences for equality, equity, need, and entitlement. Analysis of response distributions, non-response rates, reliability, and correlations with related variables shows that the four BSJO items in ESS R9 exhibit low non-response rates, reliable agreement estimation with the four principles, and expected correlations. Researchers should note, however, that the BSJO scale in ESS R9 offers manifest indicators, which may not fully capture the entire spectrum of distributive principles but focus on their specific aspects."
A systematic review and meta-analysis of procedural justice and legitimacy in policing: the effect of social identity and social contexts,"Aims: To conduct a systematic review examining how social identity and contexts influence the link between procedural justice and police legitimacy. 

Methods: This meta-analysis combines results from 123 studies (N = 200,966) exploring the relationship between procedural justice and police legitimacy. The analysis utilized random effects univariate and two-stage structural equation modeling techniques. 

Findings: There is a significant correlation between both procedural justice and social identity with police legitimacy. Social identity notably mediates but does not moderate the relationship between procedural justice and legitimacy. Younger individuals and those from more developed countries are more likely to perceive a strong connection between procedural justice and police legitimacy. 

Conclusion: The study highlights social identity as a crucial precursor to legitimacy and a key element in the dynamics of procedural justice within policing. It also indicates that the correlation between procedural justice and legitimacy varies among different social groups and contexts. The theoretical implications of these findings are explored."
Teachers’ Social Emotional Learning Competencies and Social Justice Teaching Beliefs and Associations with Children’s Prosocial Behavior and Community Engagement,"Background: High-quality interactions with program staff in out-of-school environments can cultivate individual and collective prosocial skills.

Objective: This study investigated if teachers' social-emotional skills in an out-of-school STEM program enriched with social-emotional learning content were linked to children's prosocial behavior, community involvement, and peer issues, and examined whether these connections were influenced by teachers' social justice teaching beliefs and the child's gender.

Method: A total of 126 students (72 boys) participated in the study. The racial composition included 41 White students, 40 Black students, 34 Latine students, and 11 Asian students, with most being third graders (average age = 8.11 years). Teachers assessed their emotional competence, commitment to social-emotional learning, and beliefs about social justice teaching. They also evaluated the children's prosocial behavior and peer problems. Students rated their own community engagement.

Results: Teachers' emotional competence was linked to lower prosocial behavior when their social justice teaching beliefs were low. On the other hand, teachers' commitment to social-emotional learning was associated with higher prosocial behavior. Girls showed a positive correlation between teachers' emotional competence and peer problems. Additionally, teachers' emotional competence was positively related to community engagement.

Conclusions: The findings show connections between STEM teachers' social-emotional learning skills and social justice teaching beliefs in the development of students' prosocial behavior and community involvement, offering directions for future research."
Learning to Lead for Equity and Social Justice through Critical Reflection and Autobiography,"In this study, the authors use critical reflection and personal narratives as teaching strategies for future school leaders to scrutinize their beliefs and assumptions about equity and social justice within an educational leadership training program. Comparative themes concerning their evolving perspectives on social justice and equity included: (a) Understanding heritage and personal experiences in relation to inequity and injustice, (b) Recognizing positionality as a tool for making sense of leadership development, and (c) Praxis: Aspiration for action in leadership. Employing pedagogical tools that engage in challenging self-reflection and societal dialogue can provide pathways for students to actively interpret their past experiences, future goals, and enhance their ability to act as agents of justice."
Focusing on the “Social” in Social Justice Research,"I explore the significant link between perceptions of fairness and actions reflecting engagement with social entities and relationships. A brief review of research on perceived fairness and its effects on fair processes highlights the social nature of responses to fair or unfair treatment—demonstrating that perceptions of fairness greatly influence individuals' sense of inclusion and safety within their social groups or relationships. I propose that this well-documented relationship between fairness and group involvement prompts intriguing questions about the impact of perceived fairness on traditional group process phenomena. I examine research questions concerning fairness and social identity processes, fairness and obedience to authority, and fairness and conformity. Studying these questions, I argue, would strengthen the field's foundation in the basic social psychology of fairness and revitalize the focus on group dynamics in social psychology as a discipline."
AI ethics and ordoliberalism 2.0: towards a ‘Digital Bill of Rights’,"This paper examines AI ethics from a unique perspective rooted in business ethics, specifically 'ordoliberalism 2.0.' It contends that the current debate on (generative) AI overly depends on corporate self-regulation and voluntary guidelines, thereby lacking proper governance mechanisms. To remedy this, the paper proposes enacting stringent legislation with a more effective oversight system, in addition to integrating existing AI guidelines with an ordoliberal-based regulatory and competitive policy. However, the connection between AI ethics, regulation, and antitrust issues has not been sufficiently explored in scholarly literature or beyond. By doing so, the paper fills a crucial gap in academic research and contributes to the predominantly legal-political and philosophical discussions on AI governance. The research aims are twofold: first, to identify ordoliberal-inspired AI ethics principles that could form the basis for a 'digital bill of rights'; second, to demonstrate how these principles could be applied on a macro level through ordoliberal competition and regulatory policies."
From AI Ethics Principles to Practices: A Teleological Methodology to Apply AI Ethics Principles in The Defence Domain,"This article outlines a method for interpreting AI ethics principles to determine specific ethical standards for developing and implementing AI systems in high-risk areas. The method involves a three-stage process conducted by an independent, diverse ethics committee to: (1) establish the appropriate abstraction level for modeling the AI lifecycle; (2) translate the given principles into detailed requirements for each stage of the AI lifecycle; and (3) develop criteria to guide the context- and purpose-specific balancing of these principles. The described methodology is meant to be flexible, adaptable, and reproducible, and when implemented within a pro-ethical institutional culture, it aims to promote the ethical creation, development, and use of AI systems. The methodology’s application is demonstrated using the AI ethics principles from the UK Ministry of Defence."
Reflections on Putting AI Ethics into Practice: How Three AI Ethics Approaches Conceptualize Theory and Practice,"Critics argue that current methodologies in applied ethics for AI are overly focused on principles, creating a disconnect between theory and practice. Various applied ethics methods attempt to bridge this gap by conceptually translating ethical theories into practical applications. In this paper, we investigate how the leading contemporary AI ethics approaches translate ethical concepts into practice. We scrutinize three specific approaches: embedded ethics, ethically aligned approaches, and the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach. Our analysis evaluates how each approach conceptualizes theory and practice, highlighting their strengths and limitations: the embedded ethics approach is context-oriented but may be biased by specific contexts; ethically aligned approaches focus on principles but lack theories for resolving conflicts between principles; and the interdisciplinary Value Sensitive Design approach prioritizes stakeholder values but requires connections to political, legal, or social governance factors. From this analysis, we propose a meta-framework for applied AI ethics with three essential dimensions. Grounded in critical theory, we recommend these dimensions as starting points for scrutinizing the relationship between theory and practice. First, incorporating the dimension of affects and emotions in ethical decision-making can reveal vulnerabilities and marginalized experiences during AI development. Second, considering the dimension of justifying normative background theories provides benchmarks and criteria for prioritizing and evaluating conflicting principles. Third, considering governance in ethical decision-making illuminates power structures and supports the development of ethical AI by integrating social, legal, technical, and political concerns. This meta-framework serves as a tool for comprehending, mapping, and evaluating theory–practice conceptualizations in AI ethics to address their inherent gaps."
A semi-automated software model to support AI ethics compliance assessment of an AI system guided by ethical principles of AI,"Adhering to ethical AI principles and guidelines profoundly affects companies involved in creating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Ethics, a broad and ever-changing concept, varies across cultures and regions. International organizations (IOs), governments, and private entities all strive to define AI ethics. Numerous decisions on AI ethics have been issued by IOs, regional, and national bodies. Crafting a compliant system within this ethical framework presents a considerable challenge for companies, with significant repercussions for non-compliance, making adherence to these standards critically important. Additionally, there is a lack of technical tools to ensure AI systems meet ethical standards. The deficiency of such compliance-checking tools, coupled with the ongoing effort to define ethical guidelines for AI development, has prompted us to propose a semi-automated software model to verify the ethical adherence of AI system code. To develop this model, we consider: (1) a literature review to identify current ethical compliance systems, (2) an analysis of ethical AI principles and guidelines to capture international and European perspectives on AI ethics, and (3) the identification of widely accepted AI principles and sub-principles. These considerations informed (4) our design proposal for a semi-automated software to verify ethical compliance of AI systems during design (ethics-by-design approach) and post-development."
Towards AI ethics’ institutionalization: knowledge bridges from business ethics to advance organizational AI ethics,"This article aims to raise awareness about developing ethics for artificial intelligence (AI) by leveraging knowledge from other areas of applied ethics, notably business ethics, emphasizing organizations and institutional processes. As AI systems have rapidly evolved in recent years, a renewed and vigorous discussion on AI ethics has surfaced, concentrating on ethical concepts, theories, and application contexts. We propose that insights from business ethics can beneficially spill over into AI ethics, as discussions about ethical and social responsibilities have been implemented as voluntary or mandatory regulations in both national and international contexts. Consequently, business ethics can inform AI ethics in five key areas that have been explored and institutionalized: (1) stakeholder management, (2) standardized reporting, (3) corporate governance and regulation, (4) curriculum accreditation, and collectively (5) AI ethics washing, akin to greenwashing. By detailing these five knowledge transfers, we highlight prevailing challenges in AI ethics and suggest how business ethics insights can advance the discourse. Concurrently, we assert that business ethics can gain from AI ethics in adapting to the digital transformation, fostering mutual enrichment between the two fields. Future discussions in both realms of applied ethics could benefit from dialogue and mutual enrichment, enhancing ethical rigor and preventing practices such as ethics washing or, worse, ethics bashing."
Unveiling public perception of AI ethics: an exploration on Wikipedia data,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have increasingly highlighted ethical concerns while delivering services to individuals. People often find it difficult to recognize the occurrence of these AI ethical dilemmas. Generally, the lower the level of public awareness, the more challenging it becomes to resolve AI ethical issues. Numerous prior studies have examined public reactions and opinions on AI ethics through surveys and social media platforms like Twitter. Nonetheless, these methods mainly emphasize identifying popular topics and sentiments, neglecting the public’s potential ignorance of these issues. Few studies have uncovered the comprehensive knowledge structure of AI ethical topics and the relationships among subtopics. As the world’s largest online encyclopedia, Wikipedia encourages collective contributions and knowledge sharing by adding new topics and adhering to a widely accepted hierarchical structure. Through public viewing and editing, Wikipedia acts as a proxy for knowledge dissemination. This study aims to examine how the public understands the corpus of AI ethical knowledge. We employed a community detection approach to identify the hierarchical structure of AI ethical topics and further identified AI ethics-related entities, such as proper nouns, organizations, and individuals. The findings indicate that the primary topics within the top-level community, most related to AI ethics, mainly focus on knowledge-based and ethical issues. Examples include shifts from Information Theory to Internet Copyright Infringement. In conclusion, this study contributes to three areas: (1) presenting the comprehensive knowledge structure of AI ethics, (2) evaluating and enhancing the existing body of knowledge on AI ethics, and (3) improving public understanding of AI ethics to mitigate risks associated with AI technologies."
How to design an AI ethics board,"The creation and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems present substantial dangers to society. To mitigate these risks to an acceptable threshold, AI firms need a robust risk management strategy and solid risk governance frameworks. In this article, we delve into a specific method for enhancing risk governance in AI firms: establishing an AI ethics board. We outline five crucial design considerations: (1) What duties should the board undertake? (2) What legal configuration should it have? (3) Who should be included on the board? (4) What decision-making processes should it follow? (5) And what resources are necessary for its function? We address each of these queries with detailed sub-questions, provide various options, and evaluate how different design choices impact the board's efficacy in mitigating AI-related societal risks. Numerous failures highlight the complexities in devising an AI ethics board. This paper equips AI firms with a toolkit to navigate these challenges effectively."
Embedding responsibility in intelligent systems: from AI ethics to responsible AI ecosystems,"Autonomous intelligent systems, capable of making decisions based on their environmental inputs, possess significant potential for positive impact but also pose substantial social and ethical challenges. The ethical discourse surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has extensively explored these challenges and suggested various mitigation strategies. This article critiques this discourse, arguing that it tends to focus on specific issues and solutions while overlooking the broader context of intelligent systems as complex socio-technical ecosystems. Expanding upon the discussion of AI ethics, the article advocates for a better understanding of what defines a responsible AI ecosystem. By introducing the concept of meta-responsibility or a higher-level responsibility, the article delineates qualities that such an ecosystem must exhibit to be considered responsible. This viewpoint is theoretically intriguing as it broadens the current discussion on AI ethics and provides a fresh perspective for researchers and developers of intelligent systems, aiding their contemplation of ethical considerations."
The ethics of AI business practices: a review of 47 AI ethics guidelines,"Numerous recent publications on AI ethics concentrate on the fairness, accountability, sustainability, and transparency of algorithmic decision-making. However, a smaller number of guidelines address the ethical considerations within the business practices and political economies that host AI systems. Our semi-systematic literature review and thematic analysis aimed to evaluate the attention given to the ethics of AI business practices across numerous guidelines. The review indicates that the political and economic effects of AI business strategies are largely overlooked in current AI ethics guidelines. Presently, these guidelines are heavily biased towards algorithmic decision-making issues, while neglecting the ethical dimensions of business decision-making contexts influenced by competitive environments, speculative behaviors, ethics washing, corporate confidentiality, and other detrimental business practices. We explore these issues and propose that future AI ethics guidelines should broaden their ontological and disciplinary perspectives to more effectively address these concerns."
Ethics in AI through the practitioner’s view: a grounded theory literature review,"The concept of ethics is frequently invoked, examined, and contested in the realm of developing AI-driven software systems. In recent times, a variety of incidents have spotlighted the ethical challenges in AI development, prompting public apprehension regarding the widespread adoption of AI technology in daily life. However, what insights do we have into the perspectives and experiences of those who create these systems – the AI developers? We undertook a grounded theory literature review (GTLR) of 38 primary empirical studies featuring the views of AI practitioners on ethics in AI and classified them into five categories: practitioner awareness, perception, need, challenge, and approach. These categories are supported by various codes and concepts, which we elucidate with evidence drawn from the studies. We offer a taxonomy of AI ethics from the perspective of practitioners to aid AI developers in recognizing and comprehending the different facets of AI ethics. The taxonomy offers an overarching view of the primary concerns that AI practitioners have regarding ethics in AI. Additionally, we provide a research agenda and suggestions for practitioners, managers, and organizations to enhance their considerations and applications of ethics in AI."

Our goal is to spark discussions on making AI ethics actionable and emphasizing its relevance to real-world scenarios.
Mitochondrial gene editing,"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause numerous severe diseases for which there are currently no cures. Due to the mitochondrial genome's multicopy characteristic, these mutations typically occur in a condition termed heteroplasmy, where both mutant and normal mtDNA coexist within a single cell. Normal mtDNA can offset the function of mutant mtDNA until a certain mutation threshold is surpassed, leading to the onset of disease symptoms. Although mitochondrial genetics has captivated significant interest, the dual mitochondrial membrane posed a significant challenge to genetic modification. Nevertheless, over the past twenty years, researchers have identified methods to alter mtDNA by importing gene-editing proteins that target particular DNA sequences. Mitochondria-targeted nucleases can specifically cut and remove mutant mtDNA in cells with heteroplasmy and in animal models. More recently, base editors have been adapted to make exact C>T or A>G changes in mtDNA. Consequently, tools for mtDNA modification have become a reality, holding significant potential to transform the field of mitochondrial genetics. This Primer explores mitochondrial gene editing, detailing the selection of gene-editing tools for mitochondria, optimal practices for planning experiments, types of analyses to conduct, and specific uses and limitations of the various technologies in the field."
Gene Editing for the Treatment of Hypercholesterolemia,"Review Objective: This review encapsulates essential discoveries from preclinical research that examined the hypothesis that modifying liver genes can decrease plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

This research introduces a novel method utilizing a Cas9 gene with multiple introns along with several gRNAs separated by tRNA sequences to target the phytoene desaturase gene in both ‘Carrizo’ citrange and ‘Duncan’ grapefruit. Remarkably, this comprehensive vector substantially enhanced editing efficiency in both citrus species, resulting in mutations at all three intended sites. Adopting this multi-intron Cas9 and gRNA-tRNA array-based multiplex gene editing system signifies a promising strategy for effective citrus genome editing, providing valuable tools in the fight against diseases like canker and huanglongbing."
Gene editing and therapy in acquired and inherited cardiovascular disorders,"Gene editing and therapy present significant potential for addressing cardiovascular diseases by facilitating precise alterations to the genetic basis of these conditions. This technology provides a focused method for correcting or alleviating genetic mutations that lead to inherited cardiovascular disorders like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), as well as for managing genes involved in age-related conditions or those triggered by excessive gene activity, which frequently lack effective treatments. By modifying the pertinent genes, the goal is to lessen disease severity, enhance heart function, prevent future episodes, and potentially extend the health span. Recent gene therapy and editing trials in cardiovascular diseases have transformed treatment approaches, instilling hope for patients with genetic susceptibilities to heart and vascular issues and advancing the quest for more personalized and effective therapies. This review compiles the genetic mutations underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the latest progress in gene editing technologies and their therapeutic applications, along with associated ethical considerations and risk factors."
Simulation of dual-purpose chicken breeding programs implementing gene editing,"Despite ongoing ethical debates, gene editing's use may garner acceptance when it improves animal welfare. A significant ethical issue in chicken breeding is chick culling, wherein male layer chicks are culled post-hatching due to low fattening efficiency. Dual-purpose chicken lines could address this issue, but unfavorable genetic correlations between egg and meat production have limited their effectiveness. Although ethically contentious, gene editing has the potential to enhance genetic progress in dual-purpose chickens and mitigate ethical issues related to chick culling. 

The simulation examined utility improvements in dual-purpose chickens under two breeding strategies: enhancing laying hens and developing a synthetic line from a layer-broiler hybrid. Each strategy was simulated with and without gene editing. Polygenic breeding values and 500 simulated quantitative trait loci (QTL) with varying pleiotropic effects created negative correlations between egg production, meat production, and overall health. Results indicated that gene editing could boost genetic gains by up to 81% over several generations, contingent on the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) edited per animal. After 20 generations, the rate of genetic improvement in scenarios with and without gene editing equalized, as remaining segregating QTL had minor impacts, and editing them could negatively affect overall health due to potential off-target edits. While gene editing can enhance genetic gains in quantitative traits, it should be employed with caution, ensuring QTL with significant effect sizes are segregating and detectable.

In conclusion, the simulation highlights gene editing's potential to accelerate the improvement of negatively correlated traits. To minimize risks associated with gene editing, careful selection of the number of SNPs to be edited is crucial for achieving optimal genetic gain."
Gene editing tool kit in millets: present status and future directions,"Millets, the sixth largest group of crops cultivated in arid regions, are crucial for the livelihood of numerous small-scale farmers in these areas. Known for their high nutritional value, millet cultivation has surged over the past decade to address the needs of the world's rapidly growing population.

TALE-based organellar genome editing and gene expression in plants,"Primary insight: TALE-based editors offer a novel approach to modify plant organellar genomes. We review and examine the latest advancements in TALE-based genome editing for plant organelles.

Overview: Gene editing technologies have been extensively utilized to alter plant nuclear genomes for fundamental research and various biotechnological purposes. Among these, CRISPR/Cas9 stands out for its simplicity, rapidity, and cost-effectiveness. However, its application faces challenges in delivering gene-editing tools to plant organelles. Alternatively, protein-centric editing mechanisms, such as those based on transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), are more readily deliverable, expressible, and targetable to organelles within plants through Agrobacterium-mediated nuclear transformation. Consequently, TALE-based editors represent a viable option for engineering plant organellar genomes, especially since traditional chloroplast transformation methods confront technical obstacles and are restricted to specific species, and direct mitochondrial transformation in higher plants remains unachievable. This review highlights and deliberates the cutting-edge progress in TALE-based editing of plant organellar genomes."

Nonetheless, delivering the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) for in vivo gene editing presents difficulties due to inadequate targeting of tissues and cells. In this study, we present an efficient delivery technique for CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs by optimizing the formulation of ionizable lipid nanoparticles. The lipid nanoparticles carrying CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs (CrLNPs) are shown to achieve high gene editing efficiencies in various cancer cell lines in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrate that CrLNPs can be effectively delivered into tumor tissues, facilitating significant gene editing in vivo. This study offers a potent platform for the nonviral delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system that could be utilized for in vivo gene editing treatments for various ailments, including cancer and genetic disorders."

Advances in miniature CRISPR-Cas proteins and their applications in gene editing,"The CRISPR-Cas mechanism comprises Cas enzymes and single-stranded RNAs that guide these enzymes to precisely target nucleic acids. Certain Cas enzymes can accurately cut the targeted nucleic acids under the direction of single-stranded RNAs. Owing to its remarkable precision, the CRISPR-Cas system has become widely employed in gene editing, transcriptional regulation, and molecular diagnostics. However, the large size of the commonly used Cas proteins (Cas9, Cas12a, and Cas13, which range from 950 to 1,400 amino acids) can restrict their utility, particularly in eukaryotic gene editing, where delivering larger Cas proteins into target cells is challenging. Recently identified smaller CRISPR-Cas proteins, containing only 400 to 800 amino acids, present a potential solution to this constraint. This article offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in research on several miniature CRISPR-Cas proteins (Cas12f, Cas12j, Cas12k, and Cas12m) and their practical applications in gene editing."
Enabling regulatory policy globally will promote realization of the potential of animal biotechnology,"Animal biotechnologies hold promise for enhancing the sustainability and security of global food systems. Government regulatory bodies must ensure the safety of food, regardless of whether it is generated through traditional breeding techniques or biotechnologies. Although some nations have initiated oversight policies for animal biotechnology, many others have not yet established such frameworks. Historically, regulatory approvals were mandated before biotechnological products could reach the market, and the expense of this process restricted the range and types of products seeking approval. To date, only one biotech animal designed for food production has been marketed under GMO or rDNA regulations. The advent of genome editing has dramatically transformed the scientific methodology for modifying DNA sequences and leveraging biotechnology to improve agricultural breeding. Consequently, regulatory discussions regarding biotechnology have evolved with these new advancements. Regulatory bodies are beginning to adapt to these scientific innovations, and an increasing number of countries aim to update their regulatory approaches based on risk assessment and the similarity to organisms produced through conventional breeding. Advances in animal biotechnology, especially in genome editing, can expedite the incorporation of valuable traits in animals, such as higher yields, disease resistance, climate resilience, improved animal welfare, and better food quality for consumers. For animals with these biotechnologically introduced characteristics to be integrated into agricultural production and reach consumers, clear, risk-based regulatory frameworks must be established, and international trade of animal products should be facilitated through aligned regulatory processes. Effective scientific communication with the public is essential to build trust in precision animal biotechnology and these regulatory frameworks. In 2022, an international workshop on regulatory approaches for animal biotechnology was held with representation from 27 countries. This synthesis presents the technical advancements, policy developments, and public engagement strategies on animal biotechnology discussed during the workshop, aiming to promote the development and implementation of risk-based regulatory approaches and policies globally."
Can I benefit from laboratory automation? A decision aid for the successful introduction of laboratory automation,"Managing the high number of daily samples would be unfeasible without laboratory automation. As laboratory practices have advanced, the roles of lab staff have evolved accordingly. This article aims to offer (bio)chemical professionals with limited or no experience in laboratory automation a guide to help them decide on the implementation of automation and choose an appropriate system. In small to medium-sized labs, operating an automated system requires not just bioanalytical expertise, but also knowledge of technical aspects. However, constraints in time, budget, and staff leave little room for personnel to delve deeply into laboratory automation, including both operating and deciding to purchase an automation system. Rash investments can lead to slow or nonexistent returns on investment and take up valuable lab space. The article is organized as a decision tree, allowing readers to focus on chapters relevant to their situation. This adaptable method lets each reader customize their reading path based on their specific requirements. We aimed to cover diverse perspectives, targeting those who support or doubt laboratory automation, staff looking to automate specific tasks, those unsure about automation, and individuals intrigued by automation but uncertain about prioritizing areas. Additionally, we assist in deciding whether to reactivate or discard existing idle laboratory equipment."
Government size and automation,"This study investigates the impact of automation on public finances. The findings indicate that as the automation rate rises, the government's size—defined by the ratio of fiscal revenues to output—diminishes. This trend results from the replacement of conventional, tax-bearing inputs with new automated technologies. The decline is primarily attributed to the effects of automation on labor, where labor income taxes (including social security contributions) constitute the main source of fiscal revenue in most developed countries. The research also conducts two further hypothetical scenarios. Firstly, it examines how individual tax rates would need to be adjusted in response to automation to maintain stable fiscal revenues from various tax sources. This scenario shows that such fiscal adjustments would have profoundly negative impacts on output and labor, suggesting that a thorough reform of the existing tax structure is essential to mitigate automation's effects on public finance. Secondly, the study calculates the capital tax rate necessary to preserve the government's size, assuming other tax rates remain unchanged, which results in a capital income tax rate of approximately 0.77 for an automation rate of 45%."
A conceptual framework for automation disengagements,"A deeper comprehension of why automation ceases to function can enhance the safety and effectiveness of automated systems. This research explores the reasons behind automation being turned off by either human operators or the system itself by analyzing semi-structured interviews conducted with 103 Tesla Autopilot and FSD Beta users. The reasons for disengagement are categorized into five principal groups and thirty-five subgroups. These primary categories include the states of human operators (5), human operators' perceptions of the automation (17), their perceptions of other humans (3), how the automation perceives the human operator (3), and the automation's inability to function in certain environments (7). Human operators disengage automation when they predict system failure, notice strange or undesirable behavior (like erratic steering or ignoring traffic lights), or doubt the automation’s ability to function safely in certain situations (such as bad weather or unusual roads). Negative experiences of human operators, such as frustration, feelings of insecurity, and lack of trust, are significant factors leading to manual disengagements. Conversely, the automation itself monitors the operators and may disengage if it detects lapses in attention or speeding violations. Additionally, the reactions of passengers and other drivers can influence human operators to disconnect the automation if they sense discomfort, anger, or embarrassment due to the system's actions. The study integrates these findings into a conceptual model for understanding automation disengagements, drawing from human factors and control theory literature. This research sheds light on the various contributors to disengagements and underscores both the operators' concerns and the social dynamics involved, providing valuable insights into potential edge cases to improve the safety and efficiency of automated vehicle technology."

Does automation improve financial reporting? Evidence from internal controls,"The advent of automation—including machine learning, robotic process automation, and artificial intelligence—represents the forthcoming significant technological advancement in accounting and financial reporting. My empirical investigation assesses whether the deployment of automation by public firms enhances the quality of their financial reporting, with a specific emphasis on the internal control environment. I derive two key conclusions. Firstly, evidence indicates that automation enhances financial reporting quality, as demonstrated by a reduction in internal control material weaknesses in firms utilizing automation. This relationship holds true across various analyses, including a levels analysis with firm and year fixed effects, a changes analysis, and a propensity score matched difference-in-differences analysis. Secondly, the findings suggest a decline in financial reporting process monitoring post-automation, likely due to the perception that automation fortifies internal controls, diminishing the need for monitoring. Initially, automation correlates with increased external audit fees and audit committee meetings, but these parameters decrease after the initial implementation period. Additionally, decreased monitoring might have associated costs: when firms with automated processes experience internal control failures, the failures tend to be more severe, as indicated by stronger negative market reactions. Overall, the evidence offers detailed insights into the impact of automation technology on financial reporting enhancements."
Automation in business research: systematic literature review,"Automation has significantly altered the business landscape across various sectors.

How do humans learn about the reliability of automation?,"In various contexts, individuals make decisions supported by automated systems, whose dependability can fluctuate based on the situation. Currently, the methods by which people monitor automation reliability remain unclear. This study evaluates cognitive learning models that might explain how humans monitor the dependability of automation. We applied several different cognitive models to analyze participants' judgments of automation reliability during a maritime classification task, where they received automated guidance. The study encompassed three experiments with eight different conditions and a total of 240 participants. Our findings favored a two-kernel delta-rule learning model, indicating that humans learn through prediction error and adjust their learning rates in response to environmental uncertainty. However, we observed significant variation in the learning processes among participants. These findings shed light on the cognitive mechanisms behind human estimation of automation reliability and offer practical implications."
Driver behavior while using Level 2 vehicle automation: a hybrid naturalistic study,"The prevalence of vehicle automation is on the rise, making it important to understand driver interactions with this technology and its safety consequences. We conducted a 6-8 week naturalistic study using a hybrid research design to assess driver behavior with Level 2 automation, incorporating both naturalistic and controlled experimental settings. Our investigation focused on four key areas: the use of automation, system warnings, driving demands, and driver arousal, in addition to secondary task engagement. On the interstate, drivers were instructed to enable Level 2 automation whenever they felt it was safe, and they did so over 70% of the time. Notably, the number of system warnings increased with extended use, indicating an evolving relationship between drivers and the automation. Our data also showed that drivers selectively used manual control in high-demand driving situations. Contrary to prevalent safety concerns, our findings did not show a significant increase in driver fatigue or fidgeting when automation was used, compared to a control condition. Additionally, observed patterns of secondary task engagement, such as listening to the radio and text messaging, challenge existing assumptions about automation leading to heightened driver distraction. In summary, our study offers new insights into when drivers choose to use automation and reveals a complex behavioral pattern associated with its use."

The fine line between automation and augmentation in website usability evaluation,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly prevalent across all areas of society, bringing economic benefits. There is a growing recognition of the potential advantages and risks associated with this technology. While it offers improved decision-making processes and greater industrial efficiency, it also raises concerns about the possible decline in human involvement in important decision-making areas. In response, a new approach called Human-Centred AI (HCAI) is gaining traction, which seeks to maintain human centrality while leveraging AI to enhance, rather than replace, professional skills. HCAI asserts that high human oversight is compatible with significant computer automation. This study explores the dichotomy of automation versus augmentation in the realm of website usability evaluation. We analyzed whether semi-automated usability evaluation tools can help evaluators identify usability issues. The study compared three different visualization methods, each representing varying degrees of automation, from fully automated to augmented approaches. The findings indicate that fully automated methods effectively identify a significant number of medium and high-severity usability issues. However, augmented approaches were more successful in identifying low-severity usability problems."

Speed of environmental change frames relative ecological risk in climate change and climate intervention scenarios,"Injecting aerosols into the stratosphere is a proposed climate intervention tactic aimed at mitigating climate risks as decarbonization efforts go on. Nonetheless, the impacts on ecosystems from such hypothetical interventions are not well comprehended. Two simulations using Earth system models explore policy-relevant scenarios of stratospheric aerosol injection aimed at achieving similar global temperature goals, with one involving a 10-year delay in implementation. Our findings indicate that this delay results in varied ecological risk profiles due to different climate speeds, which refer to the rate at which thermal conditions shift. Globally, in the simulation where the intervention stabilizes temperatures, climate speeds are statistically similar to preindustrial levels. However, swiftly reducing temperatures after a delayed deployment leads to climate speeds over land that exceed both preindustrial baselines and scenarios without intervention under current policies. Evaluating the extent of areas exposed to these threshold climate speeds provides context for comparing the ecological risks of different scenarios. These results inform discussions about the trade-offs and timelines in designing future intervention strategies and making decisions."
Increase in concerns about climate change following climate strikes and civil disobedience in Germany,"In recent years, climate movements have experienced a surge in activity, seeking to raise public awareness of the impacts of climate change through prominent protests. This study examines whether apprehensions about climate change are heightened following demonstrative protests and acts of civil disobedience. Using individual-level survey panel data from Germany, the study takes advantage of exogenous variations in the timing of climate protests relative to survey interview dates to compare climate change concerns in the days preceding and following a protest (N = 24,535). The findings reveal that, on average, concerns about climate change increase by 1.2 percentage points following climate protests. Additionally, no statistically significant decline in concerns among any subpopulation was observed after the protests. Notably, the rise in concerns is greatest when initial concern levels are low before the protests."
"AI-enabled strategies for climate change adaptation: protecting communities, infrastructure, and businesses from the impacts of climate change","Addressing climate change stands as one of today's most urgent global challenges. The effects of increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, and severe weather events are currently evident across the globe and are anticipated to escalate in the future. To mitigate and adapt to these changes, innovative, data-driven solutions are essential.

Utilizing AI for climate change adaptation can contribute to a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable future for all."
Changing how you look at climate change: attention bias modification increases attention to climate change,"Addressing the adverse effects of human-induced climate change remains one of the gravest and most urgent issues confronting the international community. Despite the critical nature of the problem, there appears to be insufficient focus on climate change in our everyday lives. Nevertheless, climate change-related information has the potential to attract attention, and when focus is directed toward a specific environmental hazard, the perceived seriousness of that hazard is amplified. Thus, the question arises whether it is possible to alter or enhance attention to climate change-related information. We present findings from two experiments employing single-session attention bias modification training procedures aimed at increasing focus on information related to climate change. In the first experiment, training attention towards emotionally positive images of climate change (such as potential solutions like wind turbines and solar panels) heightened attention to these images but not to the emotionally negative ones (such as air pollution, natural disasters, and melting ice). This effect was replicated in the second experiment. Additionally, the second experiment demonstrated that training focus on negative images of climate change heightened attention to these negative images, with a trend indicating this enhanced focus may extend to positive climate-related images. Moreover, training to attend to negative images of climate change led to increased self-reported concern about climate change. Overall, our findings indicate that attention training can augment the focus on climate change-related information, and under specific training conditions, this can also elevate concern about climate change."
Are transport networks in low-income countries prepared for climate change? Barriers to preparing for climate change in Africa and South Asia,"This study investigates the obstacles that low-income countries (LICs) in Africa and South Asia encounter in preparing their transport infrastructure for climate change impacts.

Implementing knowledge graphs in cybersecurity aids in mapping out the complex cybersecurity environment and offers technical support for threat detection and situational understanding. However, building these graphs often introduces unavoidable noise and inconsistencies, which can result in erroneous inferences and decisions. This study focuses on the creation and quality assessment of cybersecurity knowledge graphs. We manually created a dataset named CS13K and expanded the current cybersecurity ontology to develop a more adaptable ontology suitable for existing data characteristics. Using Neo4j, we constructed the cybersecurity knowledge graph. Additionally, we introduce the AttTucker model, based on the Transformer architecture, for evaluating the quality of knowledge graphs. This model leverages multiple self-attention heads to uncover hidden information among entities and relationships. By reducing the dimensionality of knowledge embeddings, it achieves evaluation results on par with high-dimensional embeddings. Moreover, we integrate path-level information among entities within the knowledge graph into the quality assessment using the AttTucker model. Experimental results on both general and cybersecurity-specific datasets show that our model considerably enhances the F1 score and accuracy in knowledge graph quality assessment tasks, surpassing other models."

Findings from a logistic regression analysis suggest that cultural diversity can decrease migrant entrepreneurial activity, particularly in self-employment. These results are backed by several robustness checks. Furthermore, a mechanism analysis with a multi-path mediation model indicates that social integration—comprising social interaction, exclusion, and identification—mediates this relationship. However, strong institutional frameworks can mitigate the adverse effects of cultural diversity on migrant entrepreneurship. This study offers a novel non-market perspective on fostering cross-cultural entrepreneurial behavior."
“People Gathered by Sorghum”: Cultural Practices and sorghum Diversity in Northern Ethiopia,"Sorghum holds significant value for the livelihoods of Kunama and Tigrayan farmers in Northern Ethiopia. This study explores the factors influencing the genetic diversity of sorghum varieties grown by these neighboring ethnolinguistic communities. By employing methods from both crop science and cultural anthropology, we examine the historical and current connections between crop genetic diversity and cultural and social elements. The spatial genetic structure reveals patterns of ethnolinguistic differentiation and admixture, indicating deep cultural and crop-related ties. However, the seed systems in both communities remain open to exchange and gene flow. Our results underscore the critical role of cultural factors in the conservation of genetic resources, as well as in plant breeding and seed system development initiatives."
How business groups build globally relevant knowledge from local contexts? Exploring the double-edged sword effect of cultural diversity,"In this research, we hypothesize and experimentally investigate whether and how region-specific learning aids in the enhancement of globally applicable learning. We also analyze the circumstances under which distinct types of such region-specific learning support global learning in corporations affiliated with groups within a developing economy. Utilizing company-specific survey data from India, we precisely model and assess the hypotheses stemming from our queries. Findings reveal that home-based and host-based locally relevant learning significantly and positively contribute to enhancing the global learning capabilities of these group-affiliated firms. Notably, the data shows an inverse U-shaped moderating impact of dynamic cultural diversity, implying that the benefits of home-based and host-based locally relevant learning on global learning are most pronounced when dynamic cultural diversity is at a moderate level, whereas the benefits diminish when cultural diversity is either low or high."
Wearing the Same Jersey? The Impact of Players’ Cultural Diversity and Shared Team Tenure on National Soccer Team Performance,"In this study, we empirically examine data from national soccer teams spanning 2004 to 2019 to explore the influence of cultural diversity among team members on their ultimate performance outcomes. Additionally, we analyze the significance of shared team tenure as an indicator of implicit knowledge and internal communication within the team concerning the relationship between cultural diversity and team performance. Addressing potential endogeneity, results from various instrumental variable estimation techniques suggested that greater cultural diversity improved on-field outcomes. Furthermore, a higher level of shared team tenure amplified the positive impact of cultural diversity on team performance."
The Cost and Benefit of Regional Cultural Diversity on the Income of Rural Workers: Evidence from China,"This study examines how the cultural diversity of urban areas affects the earnings of rural laborers. Drawing on a comprehensive micro-dataset from China and using city-level dialect diversity as a measure of regional cultural diversity, we discover that this diversity has a statistically significant hump-shaped influence on the incomes of rural workers involved in both wage employment and self-employment. This indicates a balance between the positive and negative impacts of cultural diversity on their earnings. The findings are robust even when accounting for various covariates, alternative estimation methods, different measures of cultural diversity, and a placebo test. Additionally, we observe that the adverse effect of diversity is less pronounced for rural workers with higher education, and the impact of cultural diversity remains consistent in the short term. To mitigate potential endogeneity, we apply an instrumental variable approach using city river length as an instrument for dialect diversity, with instrumented results corroborating our conclusions. Our empirical evidence also suggests that the costs and benefits of regional cultural diversity on rural workers' incomes can be linked to decreased social capital and enhanced creativity."
Cultural diversity in unequal societies sustained through cross-cultural competence and identity valuation,"In current political discussions, valuable cultural traits are perceived to be endangered by interactions with culturally different groups, such as immigrants or a dominant majority. These interactions often promote the development of cross-cultural competence (CCC), which is the skill to effectively communicate across cultural divides. However, many cultural dynamics theories overlook CCC, making cultural diversity seem at odds with mutually advantageous inter-group interaction and fueling fears of cultural erosion. Fieldwork utilizing interviews at an Amazonian ethnic boundary highlights the widespread presence of CCC. This evidence inspires a novel mathematical model that considers various developmental paths to achieving CCC and valuing group identity. This model shows that a strategy commonly adopted by disadvantaged minorities can unexpectedly help preserve cultural diversity within a single generation: Strong group identity enables minorities in an unequal, integrated society to uphold their unique cultural practices by learning those of the majority. Additionally, valuing a unique minority identity is not necessarily a rejection or threat to the majority culture; rather, CCC individuals dedicated to beneficial, extensive engagement with the majority can contribute to a cohesive, multi-cultural society."
